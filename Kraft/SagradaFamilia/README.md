A paper model with some LED effects thrown in for atmosphere!

Here's a quick video of the finished kit:

## Notes

The [Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia)
has been under construction since 1882.
The magnitude of the vision driving the project - both physically and creatively - is striking, especially at first hand.

> Update: 99% Invisible recently published a fantastic documentary podcast on [La Sagrada Família](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/la-sagrada-familia/)

Then you see the work in progress - the cranes, scaffolding, workers scurrying around the site.
But that is what I think really brings it to life. This is not a frozen, finished statement of something other-worldy.
It's a vibrant expression of the hope and aspirations of a whole bunch of people working together.

In other words, it is the ultimate maker project! Personally, I think it will be a sad day when someone declares it actually "finished".

So at the extreme other end of the maker-scale is this neat little [paper nano Sagrada Familia](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HFO3MIQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HFO3MIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=UUSQ6CYPF5HQIMLK)
kit that I picked up in my travels.

I've "electrified" it to some extent with some [LowVoltageGlowingLEDs](../../Electronics101/LowVoltageGlowingLEDs)
that animate the background, just running off a 1.5V supply. Although I think I could have slowed down the LEDs even further.

A nice effect I think..

## Construction

There's not too much to the build. Just follow the instructions! A few points to note:
* I've mounted this on half a business-card case (to fit the electronics)
* I started using super-glue (because that's all I had handy). It stained the cardboard, so I had to do a touch-up with paint. I should have a bit more patience and wait to get the right tools first!
