# #350 CircuitScribe/LiteWings

Learning about conductive ink with the CircuitScribe LiteWings kit.

## Notes

There seems to have been quite a boom in conductive paint/ink applications in recent years.
From the (google) research I've done - see [Conductive ink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_ink) on wikipedia for example -
I don't see any particular reason for "why now" .. no great materials breakthough seems to be driving the trend.
Perhaps it is more a market-pull situation - more people interested in wearables and flexible tech for example.

When I saw the latest
[Circuit Scribe](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electroninks/circuit-scribe-diy-electronic-kits)
kickstarter campaign, it was a perfect opportunity to try some out.

I received a simple LiteWings kit recently, and was impressed. After making the wing kits I still have ink in the pen,
so now looking for novel applications;-)

### Unboxing

It is pretty simple!

## Construction

Depending on how densly one colors in a "wire", the resistance can range from 35Ω to 75Ω (as measured on my attempts).

The batteries supplied were CR1216 3V, so no extra current-limiting resistance required for the LEDs.

The circuit is as simple as you can get:
