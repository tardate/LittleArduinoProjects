# #473 xdiskclk

An old 3.5 inch disk drive was begging to be disassembled and transformed with the addition of a simple clock mechanism to produce the "ex-disk clock".

Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

### Clock Mechanism

The
[Clock Movement Mechanism](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/All-Black-Creative-Mechanism-Quartz-Clock-Movement-Parts-Replacement-Repair-Tools-Set-Kit-DIY-Hands-Gift/32687248673.html)
is a cheap and simple AA-powered unit from a seller on aliexpress. I don't expect the time-keeping accuracy to be that impressive.

### Construction

The scultpure is a a random assembly of parts from the disk drive (platter, main board, head actuator) mounted around the clock mechanism.

As a table piece, I have it standing on the disk drive cover (bent to make a stand).
I haven't decided whether I'll wall-mount the unit yet, so instead of trimming the hands to size, I just have the minute and second hand bent to size for now.
