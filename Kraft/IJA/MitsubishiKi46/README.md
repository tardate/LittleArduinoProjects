# #671 Mitsubishi Ki-46 Trainer

Building a SG$5 bargain ARII 1:72 kit of the Mitsubishi Ki-46-II Dinah Trainer (no electronics)

## Notes

The [Mitsubishi Ki-46](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Ki-46) was a twin-engine reconnaissance aircraft
used by the Imperial Japanese Army.

Type 100 Command Reconnaissance Aircraft (一〇〇式司令部偵察機)

The trainer variant of the Ki-46 II had a re-designed cabin with the extra bubble top over the already impressive greenhouse-like canopy.

### The Kit

I picked up the
[ARII kit #53016](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/arii-53016-mitsubishi-ki-46-ii-dinah-trainer--371434)
for SG$5 at a charity sale. Not a bad deal!

I subsequently discovered that the kit is available in new boxing off the shelf in Japan for I think around ¥1400.

The decals were a write-off however, but I managed to find a few replacements in my spares.
Only require decals 1 + 3 (hinomaru in two sizes)

| Decal | Qty | inner dia | outer dia |
|-------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| 1     |  4  | 18mm      | 19.5mm    |
| 3     |  2  | 8mm       | 10mm      |

I selected a couple of figures from the
[Hasegawa Japanese Navy Airmen Set No. X72-16 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/hasegawa-x72-16-japanese-navy-airmen-set--1123725)
to replace the very poorly molded figures that are included in the ARII kit.
Navy not army, but after all the careful painting, not really visible through the canopy anyway!

### Build Log

I selected a couple of figures from the Hasegawa Japanese Navy Airmen Set to replace the very poorly molded figures that are included in the ARII kit

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

Navy not army, but after all the careful painting, not really visible through the canopy anyway!

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

One of the problems with the kit is for the trainer variant they have re-molded to canopy, but the cockpit interior does not provide a proper seat of detail for the dorsal position. I presume this would have been an instructor seat?

![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

I'd never paid much attention to the Ki46, but the more I worked on it, the more I realised it has really beautiful lines - up in the same class as the Mosquito IMHO

![build02a](./assets/build02a.jpg?raw=true)

Test fitting the canopy

![build02b](./assets/build02b.jpg?raw=true)

The bird-cage canopy of the trainer version is just wild! And a bit of a masking job..

![build02c](./assets/build02c.jpg?raw=true)

I primed with Mr Hobby Aqueous Surfacer 1000 white.

![build03a](./assets/build03a.jpg?raw=true)

I used a light matt yellow undercoat with the idea this would give a bit or warmth to the orange. Not sure if this was a good idea in the end - made the orange too bright I think?

![build03b](./assets/build03b.jpg?raw=true)

This time, I decided to try @propblurmodels for in-flight effect, and I really like it. I think I could push the fade of the painting even further for more realism.

![build04a](./assets/build04a.jpg?raw=true)

The figures were navy not army, but after all the careful painting, not really visible through the canopy anyway!

![build04b](./assets/build04b.jpg?raw=true)

A quick base to simulate a dusty runway. Just some scrap styrofoam, plaster and some paint.

![build05a](./assets/build05a.jpg?raw=true)

![build05b](./assets/build05b.jpg?raw=true)

![build05c](./assets/build05c.jpg?raw=true)

![build05d](./assets/build05d.jpg?raw=true)

![build05e](./assets/build05e.jpg?raw=true)

![build05f](./assets/build05f.jpg?raw=true)

The full effect of the propblur thundering along a dusty runway!
