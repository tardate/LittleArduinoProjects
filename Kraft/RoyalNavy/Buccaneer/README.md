# #626 Blackburn Buccaneer S.2C

An excuse to build another sea base - this time for an aircraft - the RN Blackburn Buccaneer S.2C from Airfix in 1:72 scale,
tooling around the North Sea at 30ft.

## Notes

The
[Blackburn Buccaneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Buccaneer)
entered Royal Navy service in 1962 as a carrier-capable aircraft designed for low-level shipping attacks.
It was later also used by the RAF as a nuclear-capable supersonic interdictor.
It saw action in the first Gulf War of 1991 before being retired in 1994.

## The Kit

The [Blackburn Buccaneer S.2C Airfix No. A06021 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a06021-blackburn-buccaneer-s2c--1190161)
kit is a relatively new tool (2019)
and proved to be exceptionally well engineered. It is a great build.

Since the kit-supplied aircrew are identical and not pose-able,
I picked up some replacements from PJ Productions.
These are a little more detailed: [Modern RAF seated in aircraft PJ Production No. 721118 1:72](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/pj-production-721118-modern-raf-seated-in-aircraft--180890)

## Construction Gallery

the build is a breeze - really well engineered. Doesn't take long to get to priming.
The kit is not explicitly designed for wheels-up/in-flight, but the modification is pretty straight-forward

![build01a](./assets/build01a.jpg?raw=true)

the cockpit is reasonably well detailed out of the box

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)

The kit does contain crew figures, but they are not pose-able and are identical. I got some replacements from PJ Productions.
