## Notes

I've had the other half of the guitar I used for [LEAP#018 Fretboard](../../Fretboard) sitting on a shelf ever since.
It's almost been thrown out a number of times, but luckily I didn't as it proved to be inspiration for this last-minute idea for a party decoration.

I only had a couple of hours so I used a few modules here where I think I would have preferred to use discrete circuits.
But it did the job!

The basic idea:

* sound input
* 2 LED strip circuits independently controlled
* simple Arduino sketch to sample the sound and drive the LED strips with PWM


## Driving the LED Strips

I had some [12V LED strips](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Arrival-5M-300Leds-Non-waterproof-RGB-Led-Strip-Light-3528-DC12V-60Leds-M-Fiexble-Light/32294020575.html)
available in vaious colors. I chose some fixed color strips: one blue, the other white.

As they require 12V, I'm powering the whole device from a 12V supply (actually an old DVD power adapter I think).

IRF3205 N-channel MOSTFETs provide low-side control of the LED strips, yet can be adequately switch with only 5V on the gate (and a common ground).

The LED control circuitry is mounted on a small piece of protoboard that is pinned to insert as a shield on an Arduino Uno.


## Sound Module

I had a [Sound Detection Sensor Module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/free-shipping-Voice-Sound-Detection-Sensor-Module-for-Arduino-DIY-Intelligent-Smart-Vehicle-Robot-Helicopter-Airplane/32766584952.html) in the parts box and decided to use this rather than build a disrete input sircuit.

I didn't read the specs before hand - and it turns out this is not exactly what I was after.
I assumed it provided a continous analog input, however it turns out is is a digital sensor circuit:

* it has an on-board threshold setting (potentionmoter)
* output is either HIGH or LOW is sound intensity is above or below the threshold

Unfortunately, I only realised this after the build, which is why the sketch is written assuming continuous input, and why I added a separate threshold input (100kÎ© pot on A2)


## The Arduino

I used an Arduino Uno for the build (because of time), but did envisage using a bare ATmega328 or even ATtiny, hence why I put a 7805 on the protoboard, and used this
to power the Arduino directly from 5V.

There is a jumper to connect the 5V line. with the jumper remove, one can power the Arduino over USB (for programming and testing), while driving the LEDs with 12V.


## Performance and Next Steps

Although the party is over now, I may make some further mods. Main two ideas:

* replace the sound module with an electret or piezo transducer circuit to provide continous input
* substitute the Uno with a discrete mcu - perhaps even an ATtiny
