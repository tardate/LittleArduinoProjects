# #579 Snowflake Lamp

Finding a new home for some @LuckyResistor Snow Flake boards in a lamp stand.

## Notes

I'm in the process of unpacking after a rennovation and I discovered some long-forgotten
[Snowflake decorations](https://luckyresistor.me/projects/snow-flake-decoration/) designed by
[@LuckyResistor](https://twitter.com/LuckyResistor) who I got to know through the Boldport Club - see [LEAP#355 Snow Flake](../) for my original build.

While wondering what I might do with them, I unpacked an old horse-scultpure lamp and found my answer!

This is a simple build (my workbench is not quite back in action yet!) where I basically:

* removed the original AC-powered lamp
* re-wire with a CR2032 battery and switch on the side of the lamp
* hang the 4 snowflakes in the lamp

## Construction

Battery is on a small piece of protoboard in the base of the lamp:
