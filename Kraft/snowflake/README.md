# #355 Snow Flake

The Snow Flake is an Atmel SAM D ARM Cortex-M0-controlled LED ornament produced by @LuckResistor and shared with the Boldport Club community as a special project.

Here's a quick demo of my first Snow Flake running in solo mode...

## Notes

When [@LuckyResistor](https://twitter.com/LuckyResistor) announced the [Snow Flake](https://luckyresistor.me/order-snow-flake-panel/)
to the Boldport Club community, I knew I had to join in!
It was fascinating watching the design evolve and the production process get underway. And then one day
my batch of 5 snow flake kits arrived!

I've just completed building the first, and it went without a hitch.
Once I have built some more I will be able to experiment with co-ordinated operation, but even a single snowflake makes
an impressive display.

### Parts

The Snow Flake is a custom 2-sided board with SMD components.
The heart of the board is an [Atmel SAM D ARM Cortex M0](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/sam-d.aspx),
which drives an array of 19 white LEDs.

## Circuit Schematic

### Power Board

The kit came with a bonus small white board that is an optional small power converter.
It can be used to build a simple power adapter to convert USB 5V down to 3.3V for the snow flakes.
I haven't used this yet.

There's a BOM for the [Snow Flake Power Converter](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/dVbVIUxg) on octopart.

### Construction

I followed the basic build procedure recommended by @LuckResistor:

* Solder the 0402 LEDs onto the board.
* Solder all of the other components the other side of the board.
* Before you program the chip, power the board with 3.3V and test the LEDs. Use a wire to ground and touch the correct pins of the MCU with ground and check if all LEDs light up. If not, search for problematic solder joints.
* Connect the wires to the snow-flake and chain them.
* Program all snow-flakes with the firmware.

I picked up some construction hints along the way:

* The polarisation of the LEDs: They always point inwards, and the pads have a very small marking visible in the solder mask.
* The LEDs are very small! I used a procedure based on a technique described by @prof:
  - unwind 19 LEDs from the tape onto a white plate or saucer
  - organise the LEDs so they are all face up (I use a very fine paintbrush and toothpick for this)
  - use tweezers to transfer the LEDs to the board near their final position
  - apply solder paste to the LED pads
  - use multimeter diode tester to get the right orientation
  - push/move the LED onto the pasted pads with the probe leads or tweezers

@LuckResistor produced some videos to demonstrate construction:

### Assembly

I don't have a stencil but I decided to try hand-applied paste and hot air. This is fiddly, but worked fine.

The LED side is most challenging, as those suckers are mighty small!

![snowflake_led_side](./assets/snowflake_led_side.jpg?raw=true)

Component-side was more straight-forward, but it was important to test all component connections (
I had a few that were open after the first pass with hot-air).

### Programming

An SWD programmer is required to program the micro controller. Options inclde:

* [Atmel ICE](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atatmel-ice.aspx)
* [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/collections/frontpage/products/black-magic-probe)
* [Segger J-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/)
* [STlinkV2](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) - or a clone from aliexpress;-)
* or a DevBoard with built-in programmer


I have both a Black Magic Probe and STlinkV2 on hand, but only had the correct cable for the BMP, so I went with that.

I haven't compiled the sources from scratch yet. My first tests were with the binaries from
[threebytesfull](https://gist.github.com/threebytesfull/71f3f95ef52979a6a0375818320d0c3d).
Note: @luckyresistor subsequently added [FirmwareBinaries](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/SnowFlakeProject) to the GitHub project.

The snow flakes have to be programmed individually using a SWD programmer.
Perhaps someone will take up @luckyresistor's challenge to write a boot loader to automatically write the firmware from the first snow flake over the data connection to all other snow flakes;-)

#### Flash with the Black Magic Probe

I knew the BMP should work fine, since [threebytesfull](https://github.com/threebytesfull/SnowFlakeProject#flashing) had already documented the same.

With the ARM gcc toolchain installed, all that is required is:

* find the port of the BMP - I'm on MacOSX, so it appeared for me as `/dev/cu.usbmodem7BB19AA1`
* the compiled ELF binary

Plug in a Snow Flake and flash the chip:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb -nx --batch \
  -ex 'target extended-remote /dev/cu.usbmodem7BB19AA1' \
  -ex 'set confirm off' \
  -ex 'monitor version' \
  -ex 'monitor tpwr enable' \
  -ex 'shell sleep 0.1' \
  -ex 'monitor swdp_scan' \
  -ex 'attach 1' \
  -ex 'load' \
  -ex 'compare-sections' \
  -ex 'kill' \

### Power and Wiring

For now with one Snow Flake, I've simply wired a 2xAAA battery pack to the VCC and GND with some "invivible" 30AWG.
When I have a few more Snow Flakes I'll have to figure out a better arrangement for power and data communications.

![Build](./assets/snowflake_build2.jpg?raw=true)

### The QRP Challenge!

How much power does a Snow Flake use? @LuckResistor estimates around 18mA, so approximately 100 hours running time with 2 x 900mAh.

My first Snow Flake was deployed to test the theory.
Powered by 2 "almost new" Panasonic Evolta LR03EG AAA batteries, it ran continuously for 125 hours.
The batteries were providing 2.35V (in circuit) at this point.

This Snow Flake just won't quit! I finally pulled the plug before it died completely, as it was getting ridicuously dim.
Here's what it looked like:

### A Four-Flake Mobile

I used four Snow Flake to make a little decoration for my [Fretboard](../../Fretboard) CI build status indicator.
Just a little hack to give it some xmas cheer;-)

I mounted the four snowflakes from an improvised bit of wire art.
The copper wire carries 3.3V and additional wire (just 30AWG) is ground.
I didn't wire up the data lines because I thought it would make the wiring too prominent, and synchronisation is not important.

The Fretboard is supplied with 5V/2A, so I tapped 3.3V with an AMS1117-3.3 in an Altoids tin to power the flakes.

Here's the first bench test:

I haven't really been able to capture the full effect in a photo. IRL it is much more impressive and glittery:
