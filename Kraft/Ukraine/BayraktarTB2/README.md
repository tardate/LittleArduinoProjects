## Notes

The Bayraktar TB2 is a medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) capable of remotely controlled or autonomous flight operations. It is manufactured by the Turkish company Baykar Makina Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Åž., primarily for the Turkish Armed Forces.

It's use by
[Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2#Ukraine_and_2022_Russian_invasion)
since 2019 has now made it one of the most widely recognised military drones.

### The Kit

The Bayraktar TB2 from Clear Prop! was one of the first models of this now iconic bit of kit; probably the first with a full Ukrainian decal sheet and all the PE and resin one needs to pimp up the detail.

ClearProp are yet another Ukrainian manufacturer that covers a range of classic and obscure subjects, from the Gloster Pioneer to their latest Flogger-G. I think I was finally inspired to order a few of their kits when I saw Brett Green's beautiful H72N Hawk build in Models for Ukraine Vol 1 published by @chris.meddings.
