# #702 Austin Tilly 10HP

Building a fantastic little 1:72 Austin Tilly 10hp from ACE Models of Ukraine. No electronics in this one - just a quick weekend build.

## Notes

The Austin Tilly 10hp was one of the cheap, mass-produced light utility vehicles that proved indispensable for a multitude of military tasks serving the British Army during the second world war.

This is one of the older kits from ACE Models of Ukraine. It has its challenges but was just the right kind of quick weekend project I was looking for. I thought I punched this out OK until I compared it to what Alex Clark achieved with the BTR-3E1 in 1:72 from ACE Models featured in Models for Ukraine Vol2. Of course that's a much newer tooling (2015) with 3D CAD and improved injection molding technology. But even so.. Alex's scratch additions to the turret and overall weathering are amazing.

Alex joined Alexey from ACE Models for an interview on [Models from Ukraine podcast Episode 6](https://podtail.com/podcast/models-from-ukraine/episode-6-ace-models/).
I went back to re-listen to the episode. Not only was it inspiring to hear how ACE continues to operate in wartime conditions,
but Alex and Chris had a thought-provoking discussion on modelling current conflicts.
