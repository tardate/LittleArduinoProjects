## Notes

On May 6, 1942 a force of ten Japanese ships entered Deboyne Lagoon including the Kamikawa Maru, a destroyer, cruiser, and transports. The Japanese captured three Australian Army Signalers and five natives and established as a forward seaplane operating area.
On May 10, 1942 Kamikawa Maru departed, abandoning Deboyne Seaplane Base.

The Deboyne Seaplane base was located off Panaeati Island (Panniet) in the Louisiade Archipelago.

### About the Kamikawa Maru

Kamikawa Maru (神川丸) was initially built at Kawasaki's Kōbe Shipyard and launched on 13 December 1936 as a merchant vessel for the Kawasaki Kisen K. K. Line. On 18 September 1937 the IJN requisitioned her as an aircraft transport ship and she was refitted in 1939 as a seaplane tender. The ship subsequently saw service in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific Campaign of World War II. On May 29, 1943, Kamikawa Maru was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine USS Scamp approximately 250 miles (400 km) northwest of Kavieng, New Ireland at [01°36′S 150°24′E](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uhti48bFRSy6YESe9).

#### Kamikawa Maru Air Unit

[Pacific Profiles Volume Eight IJN Floatplanes in the South Pacific 1942-1944](https://avonmorebooks.com.au/?page=3&id=152) covers in great detail the Kamikawa Maru air unit in the South Pacific theatre from April 1942 to April 1943. It serviced in various combinations the following aircraft:

* Aichi E13A Jake
* Mitsubishi F1M Pete
* Nakajima E8N Dave
* Nakajima A6M Rufe
* tail codes:
    * initially ZI
    * changed to YII in July 1942 when assigned to the 11th seaplane tender division
    * changed to L-1 in Nov 1942 when assigned as No.1 seaplane tender

### IJN Seaplane Base on Deboyne

Between May 6-10, 1942, the IJN established a seaplane base in the lagoon at Deboyne Atoll as part of MO Sakusen, the attempt to capture Port Moresby, Papua.
It was established by units that came from Rabaul, New Britain and Shortland Island in the Solomon Islands, including the seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru.

The base existed for approximately five-and-a-half days in May 1942, including the Battle of the Coral Sea. During that time the Japanese Navy operated a small number of Aichi E13A (Jake), Mitsubishi F1M (Pete), Nakajima E8N (Dave) and possibly other types of seaplanes there.

Fortifications were minimal, consisting of felled palm trees and small-caliber anti-aircraft guns on shore, as well as any firepower on ships in the lagoon.

#### About the Deboyne Islands

The Deboyne Islands are located in the Louisiade Archipelago, off the eastern tip of Papua New Guinea.

#### Allied Operations on Deboyne - early 1942

During 1942, a small force of eight: three Australian Army signalers (radio operators) supported by five natives arrived at Deboyne Lagoon to establish a radio post.

#### IJN Capture - May 6, 1942

On May 6, 1942 a force of ten Japanese ships entered Deboyne Lagoon including the Kamikawa Maru, a destroyer, cruiser, and transports. The Japanese capture eight Prisoners Of War (POWs) in the area: three Australian Army Signalers and five natives and established as a forward seaplane operating area.

The Deboyne Seaplane base was located off Panaeati Island (Panniet). There were no shore facilities as the Japanese operated off the seaplane tender. Deboyne was under the commanded by Lt. Minematsu Hideo. During the Battle of the Coral Sea between May 7-8, 1942 Japanese seaplanes from Deboyne searched for enemy ships and during the battle, aircraft ditch in the area and their crews were rescued.

A series of raids on Deboyne were conducted by Allied forces between 9–11 May 1942

#### IJN Departure - May 10, 1942

At the conclusion of the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese withdrew from the area on May 10, 1942.

On May 10, 1942 Kamikawa Maru departed, abandoning Deboyne Seaplane Base. The Japanese abandoned several aircraft wrecks in the area including F1M2 Pete Tail RI-6 and G4M1 Betty 2271. American aircraft continued to bomb the area until May 16, 1942 unaware the Japanese had departed.

### Final Gallery - Kamikawa Maru at Deboyne 1942

On May 6, 1942 an IJN task force entered Deboyne Lagoon to establish a forward seaplane operating area.
The Deboyne Islands are located in the Louisiade Archipelago, off the eastern tip of Papua New Guinea.
The Kamikawa Maru (神川丸) was the main seaplane transport, and delivered a force of made up of Aichi E13A Jakes and probably Mitsubishi F1M Petes.

The Kamikawa Maru (神川丸) was built at Kawasaki's Kōbe Shipyard and launched on 13 December 1936 as a merchant vessel for the Kawasaki Kisen K. K. Line.
On 18 September 1937 the IJN requisitioned her as an aircraft transport ship and she was refitted in 1939 as a seaplane tender.
She served throughout the Pacific before being sunk by USS Scamp on May 29, 1943.

The build is based around the Aoshima 1:700 kit.
