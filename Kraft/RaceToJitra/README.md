# #710 Race To Jitra

Building a double-sided box diorama in mixed scales to capture the rapid advance of Japanese forces during the Invasion of Malaya.
The Battle of Jitra was one of many engagements where the advancing force overwhelmed the under-prepared defenders on the peninsula.

## Notes

In December 1941, the Japanese launched Operation "E" - The Invasion of Malaya.

The transport ships Awazisan Maru, Ayatosan Maru, and Sakura Maru,
were escorted by the
light cruiser Sendai,
destroyers Ayanami, Isonami, Shikinami, and Uranami,
minesweepers No. 2 and No. 3, and
submarine chaser No. 9.

Landings in Thailand (Singora and Patani) were unopposed, but the Indian-British brigade defending Kota Bharu put up stiff resistance before
being outflanked and overrun. This commenced the rapid advance down the Malayan peninsula, ultimately leading to the fall of Singapore by 15 February 1942.

The Battle of Jitra was fought between the invading Japanese and Allied forces during the Malayan Campaign of the Second World War, from 11–13 December 1941.

The Japanese 3rd Air Corps (飛行集団, Hikō Shudan) and three Air Combat Groups (飛行戦隊, Hikō Sentai) of the 5th Air Corps took part in the Malaya Campaign.[29] In total there were 354 Imperial Japanese Army Air Service (IJAAS) first line aircraft involved together with the 110 Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) aircraft. The Army units were variously equipped with

* fighters:
    * Nakajima Ki-27 Nate,
    * Nakajima Ki-43 Oscar,
    * Mitsubishi Ki-51 Sonia;
* bombers:
    * Kawasaki Ki-48 Lily,
    * Mitsubishi Ki-21 Sally,
    * Mitsubishi Ki-30 Ann;
* reconnaissance:
    * Mitsubishi Ki-15 Babs,
    * Mitsubishi Ki-46 Dinah.

### Build Concept

The scene is packed into a small double-sided box diorama.
From one side, the forced perspective is intended to capture the Japanese Army in the foreground, with a peek of the Navy in the background.
From the other side we see a destroyer and landing forces coming a-shore, with the action on the other side obscured by jungle foliage

This is definitely an experiment: I wasn't sure how effective the forced perspective would be.
There's some complex blocking and staging required to make the scene look right from all perspectives.

### Planning the Scene

The army is represented by a
[Type 89 Medium Tank](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/ibg-models-72041-type-89-japanese-medium-tank-otsu--999876)
accompanied by [Japanese Bicycle Infantry](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/haet-8278-japanese-bicycle-infantry--981187)
and some unmounted
[Japanese Infantry](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/airfix-a00718v-vintage-classics-wwii-japanese-infantry--1435826).

The Navy is represented by the [Destroyer Ayanami 綾波](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/tamiya-31405-ayanami--171094)

I've set the foreground (land) and background (sea) on different levels to help with the forced perspective.

Jungle foliage will help block the views appropriately

![build01b](./assets/build01b.jpg?raw=true)
![build01c](./assets/build01c.jpg?raw=true)

I found a range of trees and foliage on amazon that do a decent enough job and avoid having to scratch build all the trees

### Building a Tank

I had both a [Type 89 Medium Tank](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/ibg-models-72041-type-89-japanese-medium-tank-otsu--999876)
and [Type 95 Ha-Go Light Tank](https://www.scalemates.com/kits/ibg-models-72088-type-95-ha-go--1345408)
from IBG Models that I started building. I wasn't sure which would be best.

As it seemed that the Type 95 was most used in the Malayan Campaign, I went with that in the end,
but using the figures that came in the Type 89 kit.

## Lighting the Box

### Circuit Design

A short section of 12V Cool White LED strip is mounted in the front and rear of the box.

To make it possible to power from a 5V USB 18650 power bank, I've added a boost converter in-line to
bring the voltage up to 12V - using
[LEAP#358 MC34063 Boost Converter Kit](../../Electronics101/Power/SwitchModePowerSupplies/MC34063/ModuleKit).

### Final Gallery

Does it work? Let me know! I'm pretty happy that it came out close to what I'd planned, and all the tricks
of perspective are generally working OK!
