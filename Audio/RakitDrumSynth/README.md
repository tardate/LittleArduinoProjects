# #477 Rakit Drum Synth

Building the Rakit Drum Synth kit - a very nicely produced clone of the classic Boss PC-2/AMDEK PCK-100 percussion synthesizer.

## Notes

I just had some fun building the Rakit Drum Synth kit.
It's a very well produced kit that recreates the classic Boss PC-2/AMDEK PCK-100 percussion synthesizer,
staying very true to the original design and components.

Here's the demo from Rakit:

## Circuit Design

The Rakit Drum Synth is based on the classic Boss PC-2/AMDEK PCK-100 percussion synthesizer, with mods:

* Attack on/off
* VCO & LFO wave shape selection
* Pitch CV input

In layout and parts selection it is very close to this old AMDEK PCK-100 schematic:

The design uses a number of legendary parts that are interesting in themselves including the: the JRC4558 JFET opamp,
and Rohm BA6110 voltage controlled op-amp in an unusual SIP-9 package. These parts are common in
many famous products from guitar pedals to synths. Whether these parts are "key" to the sound is a matter of great debate;-)

I discovered interesting attempts to recreate the (now largely unobtainium) BA6110,
including this [PCB design on OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/QCnNP4oK).

## Construction

Rakit have a very clear [assembly guide online](https://www.rakits.co.uk/assembly-guides/drum-synth/).
Recommended build sequence:

* IC’s
* transistors
* diodes
* electrolytic capacitors
* LEDs
* resistors (all vertically mounted)
* Trimmers
* box capacitors (not polarised)
* slide switches
* 3.5mm mono sockets
* piezo disc wires
* potentiometers and switches
* rubber feet

My only embellishment on the procedure was to go for Boldport-style solder domes with my favourite 2% Ag solder;-)

Fitting the all the semi-conductors and electrolytic capacitors..

With remaining caps,resistors, slide switches and sockets..

Attaching the piezo pad:

And seating the pots and top-panel switches..

All finished! Rear view..

And from the top..

Here's a quick demo.. just mucking around trying to discover the range of sounds it can produce:
