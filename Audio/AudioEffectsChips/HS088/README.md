## Notes

The HS-088 chip produces a typical electronic doorbell "ding-dong", which repeats three times when triggered.
It is very similar to - and not any more pleasant! - than the kind of effect you can get with common 555 circuits
like [LEAP#059 TwoToneDoorbell](../../../Electronics101/555Timer/TwoToneDoorbell).

## Circuit

The chip requires a few external components:

* 3-4.5 V power supply
* a small signal NPN transistor such as the S8050
* 8Ω speaker
* switch
* a 100nF capacitor (104)
* a pull-down-resistor e.g. 10kΩ

A few things to note:

* most schematics available around the web do not include the pull-down resistor. I found that without this, the effect could be triggered only once and would not reset.
* the output volume is very low. It seems it would need additional amplification to be useful
