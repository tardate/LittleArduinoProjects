## Notes

The Texas Instruments [SN76477](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76477)
is a complex sound generator chip from the late 1970's and still reasonably easy to find as refurb or new-old stock.
It was covered in some detail in [Elektor Magazine 1981-03, p3-22](https://www.elektormagazine.com/magazine/elektor-198103) - "Multiple Sound Effects Generator".

It was apparently widely used in arcade games and synthesizers and does its magic by integrating a number of subsystems:

* low frequency oscillator
* noice generator
* voltage controlled oscillator
* envelope generator and modulator
* mixer
* output preamp

Features are variously enabled/controlled via pins with either:

* resistor
* capacitor
* logic level
* analog voltage level

The data sheet describes the configuration for a number of specific sound effects, including:

* steam train/propeller plan
* race car motor/crash
* siren/space war/phasor gun
* gunshot/explosion
* bird chirp
* musical organ
* steam train with whistle

As a first simple demonstration, I've put the "propellor plane" on a breadboard below.

### Breadboard Adapter

The SN76477 comes in unusual "N" and "NF" DIP sizes. I think these correspond to
[JEDEC MS-011](https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/ms-011-b) and
[JEDEC MS-010](https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/docs/ms-010-c).

The pin and row spacing is not compatible with a breadboard so I whipped up a simple adapter with some protoboard.
I didn't go full dead bug, as I wanted to keep the pin assignments in conventional arrangement.

## Construction

This is the "propeller plane" configuration described in the data sheet.

The "speed" of the engine is controlled with a variable resistor input to the low frequency oscillator on pin 20.
