## Notes

This is a 10W guitar practice amplifier circuit and was designed for the
[Fundamentals of Audio and Music Engineering: Part 1 Musical Sound & Electronics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-engineering)
course offered by University of Rochester on Coursera.

The amplifier itself is designed to teach simple tone and distortion circuitry.

Hardware and other parts:

* DIP8 IC socket (for the TL072)
* SPDT power switch
* 2.1mm power jack
* 12V DC power supply
* 1⁄4” Phono plug
* speaker
* perfboard/PCB

### Cabinet Design - TODO

Some reasonable dimensions:

1. A well rounded frequency response translates to a cabinet volume of roughly 5832 cm^3, or interior dimensions of 18 cm x 18 cm x 18 cm.
2. For a bass heavy amplifier, a cabinet volume of roughly 2754 cm^3 will work better. This corresponds to interior dimensions of 18cm x 18cm x 8.5cm.

Styrofoam board can be used for a quick build, but a wooden case will sound slightly better.

I've mounted mine in a wooden box of about 2700 cm^3 volume, with a removable rear panel so I can experiment with tone.

### Performance

Sample oscilloscope trace:

* 12V power
* CH1: input (1kHz, 20mV sine)
* CH2: output, minimum gain & tone
