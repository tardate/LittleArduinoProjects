# #623 Electret Sound Detection Module

Reverse-engineering a commercial electret sound detection module intended for use with an Arduino/microcontroller as a sound level trigger (not audio pre-amp).

## Notes

I bought a [Sound Detection Sensor Module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32607737910.html)
some time back. Similar modules are available from many sellers on the usual marketplaces (aliexpress, ebay, taobao).

I don't think I'd be the first to think I was buying an electret audio pre-amp module,
only to discover they are actually configured as binary sound level triggers.

Basically, this means that when the sound level goes above a configurable threshold, the input will go from LOW to HIGH.

The input would usually be connected to a microcontroller GPIO and be used for sound-activated trigger event.

NB: see [LEAP#681](../ElectretPreamp) for coverage of a legit Electret Audio Pre-amplifier.

### Module Specs

As given by one of the sellers:

Features:

* 100% Brand new and high quality
* Signal output indication
* Single channel signal output
* The output effective signal is low level
* When there is sound, output low level and the signal lights
* Can be used for Acoustic control light; give sound and light alarm working with Photosensitive sensor

Specifications:

* Size: approx.32mm*17mm*15mm(length*width*height)
* Main Chip: LM393, Electret condenser microphone
* Working Voltage: DC 4-6V
* Color: Blue
* Net Weight: 3g
* Note: The Maximum induction distance is 0.5M

### Circuit Design

Here's my redrawing of the circuit. It basically comprises:

* electret input ac-coupled to S9014 common emitter amplifier
* amplified output (normally HIGH) is fed to inverting input of the LM393 comparator
* 10kÎ© pot is used to set the comparator threshold (non-inverting input)
* the signal output is pulled HIGH by default R6, but is normally LOW when insufficient sound to trigger
* when the output is LOW, the green LED indicator will light
* a red LED is power indicator

### Behaviour

The output is a rail-rail digital signal, suitable for connection toe a GPIO pin of a microcontroller.

The threshold level would be set so that any sound over a certain volume would cause the output to toggle.
It is possible to adjust for both output orientations:

* adjust so normally output is high. Loud sound will cause the output to toggle high
* adjust so normally output is low. Loud sound will cause the output to toggle high

The trace below captures the module output when exposed to a pure 1kHz sine wave input sound.
With the threshold set at just the right level, and given the input is a pure sine wave,
the output is a square wave oscillating at the same frequency for each phase of the sound wave that exceeds the threshold
