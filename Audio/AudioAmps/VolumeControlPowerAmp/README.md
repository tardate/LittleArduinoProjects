# #097 Volume Control Power Amp

An LM386 fixed-gain audio power amp with volume control.

## Notes

This variant in the line of LM386-based amplifiers is based on a design in [Beginning Analog Electronics through Projects](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0750672838/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0750672838&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=QUZ3GKIDBEXGNSG7).

It is similar the [Little Gem/A386](../LittleGem), but with a few differences:

* The LM386 gain is actually fixed at 200x with 10μF C5, with volume control on the input provided by R1.
* it adds a small RF-bypass capacitor C2 to prevent RF-breakthough of radio signals
* the output coupling capacitor is slightly smaller at 10μF
* additional 100nF low-pass filter on the power supply

How it performs:
* the input volume control works fine, although it is pretty redundant as it is ding the same job as a guitar's onboard volume control
* the RF-bypass capacitor does appear to give a cleaner signal
* the lack of gain control means the overdrive level is fixed. It's a pretty nice and warm effect that cuts in with higher input volumes
