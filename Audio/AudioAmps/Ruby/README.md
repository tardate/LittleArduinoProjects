# #104 Ruby Guitar Amp

A version of the runoffgroove Ruby LM386 guitar amp.

## Notes

The Ruby amp is similar to the [LittleGem](./LittleGem), however it introduces a JFET buffer on the input
and discrete volume and gain controls.

The build here is based on the [runoffgroove schematic](http://www.runoffgroove.com/ruby.html), but with a few variations:
* adds a coupling capacitor on the input
* J201 n-channel JFET instead of the original MPF102

## Construction

NB: in the schematic below, the FET symbol is not quite correct (shows n-channel MOSFET instead of JFET)

## Breadboard Build

Running the amp on a breadboard is possible, but noise and interferance can be a real problem.
So performace on a breadboard is not a very good indicator of actual performance if you build the circuit on a PCB.

## Prototype Build

Running on a protoboard. Works really well! I need to find some pots to replace the trimmers then I can mount it properly.

Here's the layout I used:
