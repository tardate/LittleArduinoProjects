## Notes

Yet another LM386-based audio amplifier
similar to the [LittleGem/A386/Smokey](../LittleGem) series,
this time adapted as a guitar headphone amp.

There are various "headphone amp" circuits based on the LM386.
After trying many of the variations, I found that going back to basics performed just about the best
(per the reference circuits in the datasheet).

Features of the circuit:
* default 20x gain (no extra components required)
* simple capacitive-coupling with ~50k impedence matching for a guitar input
* ring of the 6.35mm connector is used to switch power - use with a standard mono cable
* mono output is sent to left and right channels of the headphone socket

How it performs:
* clean signal with a slight warm overdrive at maximum guitar ouput
* performance can be a bit temperamental on a broadboard, but when I put it on a protoboard it performs quite well.
