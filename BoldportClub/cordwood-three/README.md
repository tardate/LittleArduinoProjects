# #411 cordwood-three

Custom build of the Boldport Club Cordwood Puzzle III, Project #25, May 2018, with an archway layout and a spring-loaded LED trigger machanism.

Here's a quick demo of the build on a custom test jig "LED Blinky Machine"..

## Notes

This is the third Boldport Club project in the Cordwood series.
See my build of the [first](../cordwood) and [second](../cordwood-too).
Here they are all together:

## The Kit

The kit arrrived in the familar brown paper

![kit_arrival](./assets/kit_arrival.jpg?raw=true)

![kit_parts](./assets/kit_parts.jpg?raw=true)

If you want to build this kit, the easiest way is to join the club and order the [BoldportClub kit](https://www.boldport.com/products/cordwood-puzzle-three).
But you could do it without the kit:
the [PCB design is open source](https://github.com/boldport/cordwood-three) so it is relatively easy to make an identical (or similar) set of boards,
and the parts are relatively easy to obtain:

## Schematic

The circuit is similar to the other cordword projects: essentially an array of
LEDs with low-side NFET switches. By default, the LEDs are on with a pull-up resistor on the MOSFET gates.
The gate is exposed via pin header so it can be pulled low (turning off the LED).

## Construction

The conventional construction is a vertical stack. The Boldport guide outlines the construction:

[![conventional_layout](./assets/conventional_layout.jpg?raw=true)](https://www.boldport.com/products/cordwood-puzzle-three)

I played around for a bit looking for alternatives, and settled upon an archway style which I found quite appealing;-)

![build-side](./assets/build-side.jpg?raw=true)

So that's working fine - I can toggle the LEDs by pulling any of the 6 gate pins low.

Here are my working notes for re-arranging the connections...

## A Custom Test Jig - LED Trigger Machine

So without getting too fancy, I wanted a nicer way of mounting and testing the project.
One thing lead to another, and soon I had a completely pointless LED blinking machine:

* I used the box from [The Boldport Gent](../TheGent) project as a base
* 4 x AAA in the box
* power switch
* and a spring-loaded trigger mechanism for blinking the LEDs

![Build](./assets/cordwood-three_build.jpg?raw=true)

Close up on the trigger machnism - a bit of ad-hoc wire craft and a spring:

Power and switch connections inside the box:
