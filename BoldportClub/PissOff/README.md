The core subsystems of the project:

* 3.3V linear regulator provides power for all components
* SD card adapter for audio file retrieval
* an infrared (IR) transmitter and receiver
* audio mixer and low-pass filter
* audio amplifier and speaker
* ARM Cortex-M0+ microprocessor to tie it all together

## Using Solder Paste and Stencils

While you can hand-solder the project, it also presents a nice opportunity to experiment with reflow techniques.

I found this great tutorial from sparkfun, everything I need to know to do a decent job of my first reflow with stencil:

[![Stenciling Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WDIqtGMROjM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIqtGMROjM)

## Reflow Assembly

I decided to try my hand at some reflow. I'm using the stencil from OSH Stencils, some 63/37 solder paste and a hand-held hot air gun.

Stencil and board taped down with kapton in an ad-hoc PCB frame:

![assembly_setup](./assets/assembly_setup.jpg?raw=true)

Solder paste applied, all components mounted:

![assembly_placement](./assets/assembly_placement.jpg?raw=true)

After reflow with hand-held hot-air gun:

![assembly_reflow](./assets/assembly_reflow.jpg?raw=true)

At this stage I did a full continuity check on all soldered components to make sure the reflow had produced reliable connections.
I only found two problems:

* one of the capacitors got dislodged at some point and wasn't properly connected on one terminal
* pin 11 of the microprocessor wasn't making a good connection

No problem - couple of dabs of solder paste and reflow - now all good!

Overall, the reflow assembly process worked brilliantly:

* much faster than I could have done it by hand soldering with an iron
* I doubt I could have soldered the SD card socket by hand without a great deal of pain
* the final result looks great - almost like it came out of a factory

Next to final assembly:

* through-hole components with an iron
* hot-glue for the speaker and battery pack attachment

And here it is, ready to test:

## Code

The microcontroller comes preloaded with the correct code, and works out of the box.
To investigate the sources, or compile a derivitive work, see the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/PissOff).

First I'll get this started with the preloaded code...

## Preparing the SD Card

@fuchs has provided a [PissOff default disk image](https://luckyresistor.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/piss-off-disk.zip)
with a barking dog sound.
The RaspberryPi guide to
[installing disk images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/)
is a good resource for instructions no how to prepare the SD card.
I'm using a Mac, so [these are the appropriate instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md).


Using Disk Utility to verify and identify the SD card:

![sd_verify](./assets/sd_verify.png?raw=true)

### First Attempt

I first tried with a very old 128MB microSD card, formatted as "MS-DOS (FAT)" in the MacOSX Disk Utility tool.

Copying the disk image to the device:

```
$ diskutil list
...
/dev/disk3
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *127.1 MB   disk3
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED                127.1 MB   disk3s1

$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3
Unmount of all volumes on disk3 was successful

$ sudo dd bs=1m if=disk.img of=/dev/rdisk3
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
342016 bytes transferred in 0.026458 secs (12926740 bytes/sec)

$ diskutil eject /dev/disk3
Disk /dev/disk3 ejected
```

So far so good, but no sound when I try it in the PissOff.

Note: read on for two solutions and the underlying problem finally identified and resolved.


### Serial Debugging

Time to connect up a serial debugger!
Serial connections are on J4. The PCB conveniently has offset holes, so a pin header can be simply inserted with press-fit.
I'm using a USB Serial adapter with a 3.3v logic level mode. Only 3 wire connections are required:

| USD Serial Adapter | J4  |
|--------------------|-----|
| RXD                | tx  |
| TXD                | rx  |
| GND                | gnd |

Here is the adapter connected:

![PissOff_serial_debug](./assets/PissOff_serial_debug.jpg?raw=true)

The problem is immediately apparent. The disk is mounted but the processor can't read any blocks.
The [troubleshooting guide](https://luckyresistor.me/projects/boldport-pissoff/troubleshooting/) is a good reference for the debug interface.

![sd_fail](./assets/sd_fail.png?raw=true)


### Second Attempt

From reports I've seen in the [Boldport Slack](https://boldportclub.slack.com/),
not all SD cards work with the PissOff. The main factor seems to be older/smaller capacity cards that
probably don't support [SDHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#SDIO.2C_SDHC.2C_and_SDXC) correctly.

So I tried again with a newer 64Gb SD card, formatted as "MS-DOS (FAT)" in the MacOSX Disk Utility tool:

```
$ diskutil list
...
/dev/disk3
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *67.1 GB    disk3
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk3s1
   2:       Microsoft Basic Data TEST                    66.9 GB    disk3s2

$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3
Unmount of all volumes on disk3 was successful

$ sudo dd bs=1m if=disk.img of=/dev/rdisk3
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
342016 bytes transferred in 0.026458 secs (12926740 bytes/sec)

$ diskutil eject /dev/disk3
Disk /dev/disk3 ejected
```

And it works! Here's the serial debug output for an alarm sequence:

![sd_success](./assets/sd_success.png?raw=true)


### Trying again with an old SDIO Card


Here's why the BoldportClub slack channel rules: the SD card support issue was finally resolved by @pastva:

```
I found why pissoff can't play files from small cards (2GB).
Serial debug revealed that READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK (CMD18) returns error code.
I found that SDHC cards are addressed in terms of 512 byte blocks, non SDHC card expects byte address.
To fix it SDcard::startMultiRead method has to multiply startBlock by 512 for non SDHC cards (or << 9).
```


Then @fuchs created a non-SDHC card image: [piss-off-disk-no-hc](./assets/piss-off-disk-no-hc.zip)

I tried this image with the 128Mb SDIO card (that failed in my first attempt), and it works just fine!

Copying the image to the SD card:

```
$ diskutil list
...
/dev/disk2
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *127.1 MB   disk2
   1:                 DOS_FAT_32 UNTITLED                127.1 MB   disk2s1
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
Unmount of all volumes on disk2 was successful

$ sudo dd bs=1m if=disk_non_hc.img of=/dev/rdisk2
0+1 records in
0+1 records out
342016 bytes transferred in 0.274037 secs (1248064 bytes/sec)

$ diskutil eject /dev/disk2
Disk /dev/disk2 ejected
```

Successful initialisation and alarm with the new image on a very old 128Mb SD card:

![sd_success_no_hc](./assets/sd_success_no_hc.png?raw=true)

So it turns out my older (failing) SD cards only supported [SDIO, not SDHC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#SDIO.2C_SDHC.2C_and_SDXC).


## Schematics

The schematic is nicely documented on the card includedin the kit. Note two errata:

* the IR LED is labelled D2 on the schematic but D5 on the PCB silkscreen
* IC2 pin labelling is a little off in the schematic: missing PTB4; PTB5,6,7 offset by one and an erroneous "Enable" label inserted

As part of verifying the circuit, I redrew the schematic in Fritzing:
