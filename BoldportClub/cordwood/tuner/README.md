# #271 cordwood/tuner

Use the Boldport Cuttle & Cordwood as a guitar tuner, with a custom input preamp.

Here's a quick video showing it in action..

## Notes

The Cordwood has six LEDs. Six is one of my favourite numbers .. like the number of strings on a standard guitar.

So is it possible to use the Cordwood to detect (even tune) the six strings of a guitar?

I was thinking about doing a complete analogue solution with bandpass filters (probably active filters in order to get
very tight passband frequencies). Maybe later, but to start I wanted to try an Arduino-based approach
I'd seen in an [Instructables article](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Guitar-Tuner/?ALLSTEPS) by Nicole Grimwood.


### Input Preamp and Filter

I've modified the circuit to take an input from an electret so I can use it with acoustic instruments,
and adjusted the OpAmp configuration for simple single-supply operation using a basic LM386 audio amp.

The electret microphone is biased with a 10kΩ resistor and coupled to the amplifier with 100nF capacitor.

The LM386 uses a standard 200x gain configuration with a 10µF gain control and 10µF bypass capacitors.

On the output:

* 22kΩ voltage divider and 220µF capacitor biases the output to VCC/2
* a low-pass filter at a corner frequency of [723Hz](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(2%CF%80+*+2.2k%CE%A9+*+100nF)) cuts out most of the high frequency harmonics and noise that just confused the tuning algorithms

I mounted this all on a small prototyping board to get a nice clean signal. It is laid out in such a way that it plugs into a breadboard.
Here's the contruction I used:

And a typical output signal (open D string):

## Arduino Sketch

The initial code is from the [Instructables article](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Guitar-Tuner/?ALLSTEPS) by Nicole Grimwood.

I've update the sketch quite a bit. It now doesn't even try to be a tuner, but just a pretty stable and accurate indication of
which root note is playing.
