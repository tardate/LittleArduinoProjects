Here's a quick video showing it in action..

## Notes

[The Cordwood library](https://github.com/aaronjasso/Cordwood) by aaronjasso provides a simple interface
to the [BoldportClub cordwood](../). It provides a number of animations.

This is just a quick test.

I'm using [The Cuttle](../../TheCuttle), but any Arduino would do.

Since The Cuttle pins are aligned identically to the ATmega328 pins, the sketch
uses the analog pins for digital out, as they are the only 6 GPIO pins in an unbroken sequence.

See the [ATmega168/328-Arduino Pin Mapping](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMapping168) for details on mapping the ATmega328 pins to Arduino port names.
