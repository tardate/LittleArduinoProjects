# #419 lite2sound-bc

Building Lite2Sound Boldport Club Project #26.

## Notes

Lite2Sound BC is the 26th Boldport project, and is a collaboration with [Rare Waves LLC](http://rarewaves.net/).

It uses a photodiode to detect audio-frequencies from light, which are amplified and piped to an audio jack (or optionally to direct line-out).

Best of all - it comes in an Altoids-sized can!

See the [LEAP#420 CuttleTalk](./CuttleTalk) project for a full demo of the finished thing.

### Two Photodiodes?

The kits comes with a choice of two photodiodes: QSD2030 and QSD2030F.
These are basically identical, but the QSD2030F is in black epoxy which provides a daylight filter.
A daylight filter is intended to attenuate the effect of outdoor/sunlight and prevent it overwhelming
other signals (from reports: [YMMV](https://www.electronicspoint.com/threads/photodiode-daylight-elimination.259609/))

QSD2030

* Wide reception angle: 40°
* Package material and color: clear epoxy
* High sensitivity
* Peak sensitivity λ = 880nm

QSD2030F

* Wide reception angle: 40°
* Daylight Filter
* Package material and color: Black Epoxy
* High Sensitivity
* Peak sensitivity λ = 880nm

I'm not planning extensive outdoor usage, so I built the kit with the standard QSD2030 without daylight filter.



## Construction Tips from BC Slack!

> …oh, the feet go on the _tin_. This sense makes (@kpreid)

.. saved me doing something stupid.


> the board with this kit seemed to absorb _a lot_ of heat when I hit it with hot air. took some time to heat up (@kbx81)

.. I used hot air for the SMD assembly, but didn't have similar issues.


## Circuit

As provided by Boldport. Note: it doesn't show SW1 (on/off), which is positioned after
the reverse-polarity protection diode D2.

I used hot-air for SMD soldering, and an iron with my favourite 2% Ag solder for through-hole components and wires.
