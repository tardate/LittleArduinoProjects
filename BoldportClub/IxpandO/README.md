# #340 IxpandO

IxpandO is an input/output expansion board based on Microchip's MCP23017, BoldportClub Project #16.
Demo program covers digital output and interrupt-driven input.

Here's a quick demo of it in action..

## Notes

IxpandO is an input/output expansion board based on Microchip's MCP23017, BoldportClub Project #16.

The board design leaves the door open for various configurations.
I decided to go initially with the default setup of 8 inputs (switches) and 8 outputs (LEDs),
with an Arduino sketch to demonstrate digital output and interrupt-driven input.

The MCP23017 is the I²C variant of the chip.
See [LEAP#313](../../Electronics101/MCP23S17) for a similar demonstration of the MCP23S17 SPI variant.

## Construction

The [IxpandO GitHub repository](https://github.com/boldport/ixpando) contains the full design of the Boldport board.
The following schematic is a transcription that includes:

* optional controller (in this case, an Arduino-compatible Cuttle)
* optional LEDs connected to bank B (GPB)
* optional DIP switches connected to bank A (GPA)

## About the MCP23017

The Microchip MCP23017 is a 16-bit port expender:

* 16 GPIO ports
* Configurable interrupt output pins
* High-speed I²C interface at up to 1.7 MHz (MCP23S17 is the SPI variant)
* Three hardware address pins to allow up to eight devices on the bus
* Operating voltage 1.8V to 5.5V
* Maximum source/sink current per pin: 25mA
* VSS max current: 150 mA
* VDD max current: 125 mA

Note the current limit gotcha: `16 x 25ma >> 125mA`, so care is required not to have too many pins fully loaded at once, or pins should only be used to switch larger currents (not provide power themselves).

### Key Commands

#### I²C Write

* send control byte including the Start condition and ACK (R/W bit cleared)
* send register address byte
* send at least one data byte
* send stop or restart condition

#### I²C Read

* send control byte including the Start condition and ACK (R/W bit set)
* send register address byte
* read at least one data byte
* send stop or restart condition

#### I²C Sequential Write/Read

For sequential read/write, instead of transmitting a Stop or Restart condition,
the master clocks the next byte(s) until finally sending a Stop or Restart condition.

The address used for sequential bytes depends on whether Byte and Sequential Mode is enabled.

### Byte and Sequential Modes

Byte Mode: internal address counter remains the same after each byte transfer.
Useful for polling the GPIO register or for continually writing to the output latches.

Sequential Mode: internal address counter remains the same after each byte transfer.
Useful for bulk writes without needing control bytes to set the address for each.

### Registers

There are 21 registers. Of these, 10 replicated in two banks, and one `IOCON` register is shared.


| Register   | Purpose                                                                                                   |

| DEFVALA/B  | Default values compare register.                                                                          |
| INTCONA/B  | Interrupt-on-change comparison configuration, sets compare to DEFVAL. Default: compare to previous value. |
| GPPUA/B    | Control pull-up settings. Default: Pull-up disabled                                                       |
| INTFA/B    | Interrupt flag register; shows interrupt status: Default: 0                                               |
| INTCAPA/B  | Interrupt capture register. contains value as captured at interrupt. Default: undefined                   |
| GPIOA/B    | Port register, reflects the value on the port. Default 0                                                  |
| OLATA/B    | Access to output latches                                                                                  |


## Test Program

The [IxpandO.ino](./IxpandO.ino) sketch demonstrates

* digital output to LEDs on bank B (GPB)
* interrupt-driven input for the DIP switch on bank A (GPA)

It uses the [Wire Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire) to directly control the MCP23017,
via standard I²C connections on PC5 (SCL), PC4 (SDA).

Changing any DIP switch position triggers INTA.
The sketch attaches a hardware interrupt handler for this input, which sets a flag on change.

When the flag is set, the sketch reads all the switch positions and acts accordingly.

The demo program has a very simple behaviour:

* when all switch positions are off, it runs a demo cycle on the LEDs
* if any switches are on, it lights the corresponding LED for all switch positions.
