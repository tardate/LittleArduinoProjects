# #285 The Tap

Harking back to a 7400-series logic circuit published in a 1974 Elektor article,
this retro Boldport Club project is a classic.

## Notes

The [Touch Activated Programmer (TAP) Sensor from Elektor magazine of December 1974](./assets/elektor-12-74-TAP.pdf?raw=true) was a very early
example of a capacitive touch circuit.

And Boldport Club members were lucky enough to get a "modern" rendering of the same circuit.
The PCB design is as psychadelic as you would expect from a 70's vintage design. What is amazing is that the parts are still
quite readily available.

The PCB is well up to Boldport standards. Altough this can create some assembly confusion - you must pay close attention to
which side of the board the parts are inserted. It looks just as good both ways.

Electrically, touch pads A, B and C are connected to an NPN transistor pair in a Darlington configuration.
I've covered the operation of this kind of switch in [LEAP#130 DarlingtonTouchSwitch](https://leap.tardate.com/electronics101/darlingtontouchswitch/).

All manner of outputs are provided. For each touchpad there are four:

* `Q`/`Q1¯` - the logic-level output and its complement
* `S`/`S¯` which are logically identical, but an open-collector configuration able to sink greater current

### Behaviour

| Action        | Q1 | Q1¯ | Q2 | Q2¯ | Q3 | Q3¯ |
|---------------|----|-----|----|-----|----|-----|
| At power-on   |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |
| Touch A       |  0 |  1  |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |
| Touch B       |  1 |  0  |  0 |  1  |  1 |  0  |
| Touch C       |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |  0 |  1  |
| Touch RESET   |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |  1 |  0  |

### S/S¯ and Q/Q¯ Outputs

S/S¯ and Q/Q¯ outputs follow the same logic behaviour.

It appears the only difference is that Q/Q¯ are mostly suited to digital integration as
they are limited in the current they can sink (16mA).

* Q and Q¯ source current, logic 1 : 0.4mA
* Q and Q¯ sink current, logic 0 : -16mA

The S/S¯ outputs are controlled with low-side NPN switches and can sink up to 1A -
the absolute maximum collector current for the PN2222ATA.
Higher currents would need closer attention to heatsinking and wire/connector ratings.

## RB (Reset Bar) and CB (Contact Bar)

The RB and CB pins are intended to allow chaining of mulitple sensor units with a common reset/contact bus.

The transistor markings on the silkscreen threw me at first. They are special!
I was confused because they don't replicate the standard NPN/PNP schematic exactly.
Just focus on the arrow flow: NPN points out from the emitter; PNP points in to the emitter.

## Construction

The Boldport and Elektor resources already provide thorough details of the circuit.
But as is my way, I just had to redraw the circuit. This time with Fritzing:

![kit_complete_rear](./assets/kit_complete_rear.jpg?raw=true)

![kit_complete](./assets/kit_complete.jpg?raw=true)

Running some initial current tests. It never peaks beyond 23mA.

![kit_initial_test](./assets/kit_initial_test.jpg?raw=true)

Hooked up for monitoring under test (analog scopea and logic analyzer)

The final build:

## Performance

The first trace I took was from a transition to "A" on (from RESET state).
CH1 shows Q1 output, CH2 shows Q1¯ output.
As we can see, there's some pre-emptive voltage reduction prior to the switch and some jitter and one significant bounce.
From this we can see that using the TAP as an input for a sensitive instrument would still need some debouncing.

![scope_A_analog](./assets/scope_A_analog.gif?raw=true)

Here is the same switch with alogic analyser. There's quite a delay (2-3µs) between the analog transition and the digital - but I think that is more the
scope than the circuit. The important point is that we still see one bounce at logic levels, and the other outputs are as expected.

* CH1 - Q1 output (trigger)
* D0 - Q1 output
* D1 - Q1¯ output
* D2 - Q2 output
* D3 - Q2¯ output
* D4 - Q3 output
* D5 - Q3¯ output
* D6 - unused
* D7 - unused
