# #321 cordwood-too

The Cordwood Puzzle returns! Boldport Club Project #13, May 2017

![Build](./assets/cordwood-too_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

The original [Cordwood Puzzle](../cordwood) became an instant classic with club members, and the concept returns this year with a brand new puzzle.
The cordwoods evoke an era of stuffing massive components into small spaces. This is real hardware!

As before, it really is a puzzle, so if you don't want any spoilers - read no further.

## Power

The LEDs are rated for 20 mA with forward voltage of 2.V (yellow) and 2.2V (green).
Therefore, with the current-limiting resistor of 220立, the maximum supply voltage is around
[6.5V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2.1V+%2B+20mA+*+220%CE%A9).

## How It Works

Each LED is switched by a corresponding MOSFET.
The MOSFET gate is pulled high by default with a 10k立 resistor, so the defualt LED state is ON.

Each gate is also connected to a pin. If these are pulled to ground, the corresponding LED turns off.
