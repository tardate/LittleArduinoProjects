# #311 Juice

Building the Boldport Juice battery replacement kit (Project #12).

![Build](./assets/Juice_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

Juice is a battery replacement kit that uses a pretty nifty set of AA, AAA, A23 and CR2032 inserts
to inject the required regulated power where a battery or two would normally be required.

Power can be supplied via the micro USB connector, or any other power supply that can be clipped or screwed on to the body of the Juice.

All the structural parts punch out from the classy PCB like a model plane kit;-) The box folds up and doubles as a "Juice box".

### Regulating the Supply

The core of the kit is the ST LDF regulator, which has a very low-dropout voltage (500 mV max. at 1 A load).

Resistor networks and the "chooser" plug allow switching between 1.5, 3V, 4.5V or an adjustable output.
