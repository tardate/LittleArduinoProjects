## Notes

Making space here for what I hope will be a steady stream of beautiful kits from The Boldport Club.

It's a club you can join by subscription and receive an electronics project every month.

But unlike the electronics clubs I remember from years ago - which tended to produce simplicstic kits
for projects that while functional, few would ever really need, and they definitely weren't designed for aesthetics -
the focus here is on kits that are engaging, challenging, entertaining, and collectable.
