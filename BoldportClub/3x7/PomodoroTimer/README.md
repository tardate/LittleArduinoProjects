# #429 3x7 Pomodoro Timer

A Pomodoro timer wire sculpture using the Boldport 3x7 display and an ATmega328.

Here's a demo of it running a 5-minute countdown (I would be surprised if anyone watches the whole thing without skipping to the end!)..

## Notes

Over the years, I've become habituated to working in a [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) style -
make the day a series of tasks worked on in short blocks of time, with regular breaks.
But I've never actually used a timer - just relied on my internal clock to work in roughly 1 hour increments.

As I was building the [Boldport 3x7](../), it started to appeal to me as a very nice display to use for a non-distracting Pomodoro timer.

The sketch proved to be quite simple, using the [LRThreeDigits](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRThreeDigits) library for driving the 3x7 display.

After breadboarding the idea my first thought was to make a PCB ... but as there's been a bit of
[Mohit Bhoite](https://twitter.com/MohitBhoite) fandom in the Boldport Club recently, I was drawn into a another copper-wire sculpture.
Not very ruggedized, but it does look interesting!

Now for the true test - is it actually useful? Well, I've started using it for real as my pomodoro timer and so far so good.

Note: the two left-most digits are minutes, the last digit is tenths of minutes. This is actually why I built my 3x7 with the yellow
digit on the right;-)

### Design Concept

There's a few things I set out to achieve:

* the 3x7 displays minutes in two digits, and tenths of minutes on the 3rd digit
* the pomodoro countdown runs from at most 95 minutes, but default to start at 55 minutes (my preferred time block)
* the Arduino measures reasonably accurate time for the countdown, but I'm not going to be upset if it is a little off (less than a minute)
* before starting the count, two buttons can be used to increase or decrease the countdown respectively, in increments of 5 minutes
* when the countdown has completed, the unit will flash for a period of time
    - a button press resets the app for another countdown
    - if no input, go to sleep
* if sleeping, a button press wakes up and resets the application


### Measuring Time

How to measure time with an Arduino? We could:

* use the `millis()` function
* use an external real-time clock
* use interrupts to measure increments of time

Given that timing requirements are not critical, I'm going to start by trying to base things on `millis()`.
This counter eventually rolls-over, but since that is after ~50 days, I'm ignoring this for now.

### Buttons

Buttons are connected to pins 2 and 3, using the built-in pullup resistors.
Hardware interrupts on the pins are used to trigger related functions in code.

These buttons handle "up" and "down" adjustment of the countdown duration before it starts (in 5 minute increments).

Once the countdown has started, pressing either button will cancel/reset the counter.

If the application has gone into sleep mode, either button can be used for wake-up.


### Pin Connections

In order to reserve pins 2 and 3 for buttons with hardware interrupts, the 3x7 is connected from pin 4 to 13:

| 3x7 Pin      | Arduino Pin | Port |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Digit 1 Sink | Pin 4       | PD4  |
| Digit 2 Sink | Pin 5       | PD5  |
| Digit 3 Sink | Pin 6       | PD6  |
| Segment g    | Pin 7       | PD7  |
| Segment f    | Pin 8       | PB0  |
| Segment e    | Pin 9       | PB1  |
| Segment d    | Pin 10      | PB2  |
| Segment c    | Pin 11      | PB3  |
| Segment b    | Pin 12      | PB4  |
| Segment a    | Pin 13      | PB5  |

Note: this requires v1.2.0 or later of the LRThreeDigits library.

### Sleep Mode

If there has been no button input for 5 seconds after the countdown is complete, the program puts the processor into
[SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__sleep.html).
Since there are no additional peripherals to power, the current draw is very low in this mode.
I haven't measured it accurately yet, but according to a USB power meter it is below the ~1mA resolution of the reading.


## Breadboard Prototype

To test things out by plonking an ATmega328 on a breadboard..

## Wiring Up

I may do a PCB one day for a more ruggedized version, but I'm on a copper wire construction binge at the moment.
I don't have a detailed design - just some very rough sketches in a book (mainly to make sure I didn't get
my pin connections all mixed up). The actual design just came together by eye and a bit of patience;-)

The finished base ready for testing. The USB mini connector is for power only (I need to pull the chip if I want to reprogram).

With 3x7 mounted:

And powered up:

Next steps - I'm thinking about adding a mount so that I can hook the unit to the top of my monitor. Later...
