# #345 mostap

Upgrading the tap to **modern** CMOS and MOSFET technology, circa 1975 - another Boldport Club retro classic.
The mostap is a touch sensor using NAND-gate flip-flops and FET output drivers.

Here's a quick demo of it in action..

## Notes

The MOS TAP circuit was originally published in Elektor magazine in Feb 1975.
It was an update or the original TTL [Tap](../tap) circuit to use
"state-of-the-art" COSMOS (CMOS) components.

In practical terms, that means [4000-series logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4000_series)
instead of [7400-series logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series).

The Boldport Club version of this venerable circuit makes an additional improvement by
replacing the output stage BJT drivers with 2N7000 n-channel MOSFETs so that it really does
live up to it's name.

### COSMOS?

I love the name! The Elektor article is the first time I've come across it.
As far as I can figure CMOS was initially marketed with "COS/MOS" labeling by RCA .. so it's a trade name that was displaced by CMOS as an industry standard term.

Interestingly, the name appears to have re-emerged in recent times with the
[DARPA COSMOS program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/compound-semiconductor-materials-on-silicon) .. geared towards high speed SoC-type applications.

## Construction

The MOSTAP is designed to be chainable, but I only have one so I am not using the modifications for chaining
(dash-dot lines in the schematic).
In the stand-alone configuration:

* 5 sensors with flip-flops and output drivers (touch pad A, B, C, D, E)
* the final flip-flop (X) is configured as a monostable reset
* touch-pad X resets the flip-flops

### Initial Breadboard Test

Works OK on a breadboard, but it is a bit cumbersome..

### A MOSTAP Test Jig

I decided to whip together a test jig mounted on the Boldport box. It features:

* power connector and power LED
* female header for all output connectors
* for each open-drain output:
  * LEDs and 470Ω current limiting resistors on each open-drain output
  * 12kΩ pull-ups (so logic-level output is available)
* reset bus push-button (momentarily pulls-down the reset bus)
* common bus push-button (momentarily pulls-up the common bus)

Here's a sketch of the layout I used:

And the final build:

### Operating Mode Modification

The wire link connecting touch pad X to the reset bus is responsible
for the "one-shot" behaviour. IF removed, then all outputs remain latched until explicitly reset.

Replacing the link with a switch allows the operating mode to be selected:

* open - latched mode. Outputs remain on until pad X touched/reset bus pulled low
* close - one-shot mode. Outputs remain on until another output is activated or all reset

### Performance

The mostap performs excellently as a touch switch - with none of the bouncing and transients I'd seen in the original tap.

Here's a capture of a set of tap outputs when activated:

* CH1 (yellow) - A output
* CH2 (blue) - A' output

The mostap was mounted in my test jig for this, and the supply voltage set at 5V.
