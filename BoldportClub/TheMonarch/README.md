### Circuit

### My Take on "How it Works"

The core components:

* a 555 astable timer that is enabled when the "feelers" are touched together, running at around [48 Hz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=10&r2=10&c=1)
* 74HC273 D flip-flop, that latches the input (D) to the output (Q) on the rising edge of the clock input
* a 74HC86 quad 2-input XOR

Considering an initial condition of all registers (Q) high:

* XOR Y2 = 1 xor 1 = 0
* XOR Y1 = 1 xor 0 = 1
* XOR Y4 = 1 xor 1 = 0

So on the next 3 clock cycles:

* input D1=0 cascades to Q1,2,3

On the 4th clock cycle, Q4 goes low, XOR Y4 becomes 1, ... and so on.

I wrote a little script to simulate this.

```
$ ./lfsr.py
```

Which outputs (for the first 32 steps)..

|   31 |   1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |


The repeating pattern is obvious. This is actually an instance of a
[linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register).
Since The Monarch has XOR taps at registers 8, 6, 5, 4, the feedback function can be expressed as `x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + 1`

With that function, it should repeat every 255 cycles. Which it does..

```
$ ./lfsr.py -1
```

|  CLK |  Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Q6 | Q7 | Q8 |
|------|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|    0 |   1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|    1 |   0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|    2 |   0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
|  ... |     |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|  254 |   1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |
|  255 |   1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |



Recently Julian Ilett delved deep into LFSRs in his inimitable style with "The 10,000 Year Shift Register":

### All Bugs Together

The Monarch joins [The Lady](../TheLady) and [The Gent](../TheGent) in the Boldport Bug series.
They are all beautiful boards, so I think mounted together would be nice.

I had an Ikea RIBBA picture frame, discarded the front glass and mounted reflective film at the rear.
The bugs are all wired into a 2xAA battery pack with switch on the rear.

Here's a video of the frame:
