# #363 BINCO

BINCO is a little up or down "fidget" counter, Project #19 of the Boldport Club.

## Notes

The BINCO a binary counter that can be configured to count up or down. It uses Snaptron domes as buttons (on, slow/fast and reset).
The heart of the counter is a 555 timer driving a 74HC4020D 14-bit Binary Counter from which 11 taps drive some nice reverse-mount LEDs.

## How It Works

The 555 timer is in an astable configuration, initially disabled.

* when "count slow" button is pressed, ti runs at around [15 Hz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=1.5&r2=47&c=1)
* when "count fast" button is pressed, it runs at around [320 Hz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=1.5&r2=1.5&c=1)

The timer provides the clock pulse to the 74HC4020D 14-bit Binary Counter. The 74HC4020D provides 12 taps of a ripple-carry chain,
but the first (pin 9) is not used, probably because the chip doesn't provide pins for the next two stages.

As always, Boldport provides a very nice
[infographic](https://github.com/boldport/binco/raw/master/docs/infographic.pdf) for the project,
but here is my re-drawing of the circuit (it's how I make sure I understand what is going on!)

Interesting:

* the "on" switch only affects the LEDs; the ICs remain powered by the battery at all times. I suspect a sneaky trick to always "remember" the last state!
* but R100 stops the 555 timer running while not "on" by pulling down the reset pin.

## Construction

I decided to build the "count down" configuration, which involves making sure the LEDs point to the edge of the board, and bridging the down/right count pad.

In this configuration, R101 and IC10 are optional, so I left them off the board.
