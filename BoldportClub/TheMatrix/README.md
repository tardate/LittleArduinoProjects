# #298 TheMatrix

Building The Matrix (Boldport Club project #11) is an I²C-controlled 24x5 LED matrix display, powered by an AMS AS1130 LED driver.

## Notes

The Matrix is an I²C-controlled 24x5 LED matrix display, powered by an AMS AS1130 LED driver. It's made of 0.2mm thick circuit board so it can slightly bend. A few can be chained together for a larger display.

The project was made possible by the kind support of AMS who donated the LED drivers, and Eurocircuits who subsidised the cost of the PCBs.

Now I have one built, time to test it out. So far

* [LedTest](./LedTest) - first check under Arduino control
* [Firecracker](./Firecracker) - a firecracker simulacrum running on the Matrix
* [GameOfLife](./GameOfLife) - Conway's Game of Life running on the Matrix
* [KeypadControl](./KeypadControl) - use a 20-button keypad to write a scrolling message on the Matrix

## Construction

The Matrix is laid out in a 5x24 matrix as described in the datasheet (Figure 54).
This allows for using the AS1130 scrolling feature for scrolling without the need of communication with a microprocessor.

### Assembly

I used the [Matrix stencil](https://www.oshstencils.com/#projects/b0f4128d644cff5424abcb2829a05980179f08fc) from OSHStencils
and a hot-air gun for the assembly.

I first did the LEDs on one side then the AMS1130 and supporting components on the reverse side with hot air.
Then finally hand-soldered the pin connector.

![kit_assembly_connector](./assets/kit_assembly_connector.jpg?raw=true)

After an initial inspection, I only had a couple of manual fixups required:

* two LEDs not connected properly after reflow
* a solder bridge between two pins on the AMS1130 that wouldn't clear under hot air
