# #311 TheMatrix/Firecracker

A firecracker simulacrum running on the BoldportClub Matrix.

Here's a quick video showing it in action..

## Notes

I was a bit dubious about the possibility of creating a decent firecracker animation on the 24x5 Matrix display.
The additional PWM settings create another dimension, so the simulacrum is perhaps not so far off the mark.

To light the firecracker, I want to use a real fire of course;-)
Exposing the LM35 to a naked flame is perhaps not such a good idea .. but it is only for a moment - enough to take the temp over 35Â°C

## Code

The [Firecracker.ino](./Firecracker.ino) sketch instantiates ["Sparklies"](./sparklie.h) which represent individual animation elements.

Doxygen source documentation is available [here](https://leap.tardate.com/BoldportClub/TheMatrix/Firecracker/doc/html/index.html).
