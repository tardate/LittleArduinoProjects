# #299 TheMatrix/LedTest

Testing The Matrix (Boldport Club project #11) with @luckyresistor's LRAS1130 library

## Notes

Testing [LEAP#298 TheMatrix](../TheMatrix) - Boldport Club Project #11 - with the
[LRAS1130](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRAS1130) Arduino library from @luckyresistor.

I'm using a version of the
[LedTest.ino](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRAS1130/blob/master/examples/LedTest/LedTest.ino)
script.

### Visual Result

In the initial test I found two LEDs that needed a connection fix:

![initial_result](./assets/initial_result.jpg?raw=true)

After fixing those LEDs, all are performing correctly.
However note the intensity of a few LEDs is not the same as others.
As far as I can tell, it may be a problem with the LEDs themselves.

### Test Output

The Matrix is laid out in a 5x24 matrix as described in the datasheet (Figure 54).
This means the LED addresses A thu F are not populated i.e. only 10 out of every 16 LED addresses are used.

For the LEDs that are populated, the test script says they are all OK:
