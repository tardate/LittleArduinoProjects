# #307 TheMatrix/KeypadControl

Use a 20-button keypad to write a scrolling message on the Boldport Matrix.

Here's a quick video showing it in action..

## Notes

So... ways to get arbitrary messages onto the Boldport Matrix?

I happen to have a [LEAP#302 KeyboardMatrixModule](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/keyboardmatrixmodule/) that is coincidentally 5 keys high by 4 wide ..
a number that neatly fits into the 24x5 display port of the Matrix.

So I've wired it up and enabled a couple of commands in the [KeypadControl.ino](./KeypadControl.ino) sketch:

* pressing any single button toggles the state of the corresponding LED
* at first, it is operating on the left-most 4 columns of LEDs
* pressing S3+S4 together shift the working window 4 LEDs right
* pressing S1+S2 together shift the working window 4 LEDs left
* pressing S2+S3 together toggle the message scrolling..

Interesting ... but not very practical! Maybe good for a gadget that you can let random bystanders fiddle with your matrix display..

I had a problem getting the scrolling to stop started, but a little help from the
[BoldportClub Community on Slack](https://boldportclub.slack.com/) goes a long way!
Problem sorted: it seems you must let the movie finish by switching it out of infinite loop first e.g.:

```c
ledDriver.setMovieLoopCount(AS1130::MovieLoop1);
ledDriver.setFrameDelayMs(0);
```

A recent update to the [LuckyResistor/LRAS1130 library (v0.9.5)](https://github.com/LuckyResistor/LRAS1130/releases/tag/v0.9.5)
fixed some issues with LED brightness control. Now everything is looking so much brighter!
