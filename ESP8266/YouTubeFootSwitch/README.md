Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

YouTube can be a brilliant place to learn new tricks, especially in the realm of musical/dance performance and technique.
But if we are learning something like guitar, controlling YouTube playback can be a pain because we don't have three hands!

Hence the idea for a foot switch - allowing stop/start, skip and loop control by foot.

The solution I've put together here uses an ESP-12E ESP8266 module.
The module interfaces with the foot switch hardware (switches and indicator LEDs), and hosts a web page that plays the video.
A bit of Javascript reacts to the hardware state and controls the video.

### Construction

This project is an assembly of a few components, some of which I've built/tested before:

* [LEAP#542](../../Electronics101/InputDevices/FootSwitch) - the foot control module with 4 switches and tri-state RGB LEDs
* [LEAP#544](../../Electronics101/BatteryManagement/ShengYang18650BatteryShield) - ShengYang 18650 Battery Shield
* an [ESP-12E](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32339917567.html) ESP8266 module with an [adapter board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649040259.html)
* a custom board for mounting the ESP-12 in the Footswitch

The full circuit is as follows:

### Power

I'm using a [ShengYang 18650 Battery Shield](../../Electronics101/BatteryManagement/ShengYang18650BatteryShield) for power.
This provides 3.2V regulated output, which so far has proven quite sufficient for the ESP8266.

On the plus side, this makes the unit 100% wireless, however since it is only a single cell, the running time between recharge can be limited.

I'm having second thoughts, as I can see myself using the unit for many hours at a time.
I may replace the battery module with a 3.3V regulator and power jack for a mains adapter and live with the power cord being attached.

Charging the battery over USB to the micro USB connector. Indicators:

| LED        | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| L1 (green) | Charged |
| L2 (red )  | Charging |

### Programming the ESP8266

I'm using the ESP8266 core for Arduino and the Arduino IDE to program the ESP-12 module.
Programming is done on the [LEAP#540 DIY Dev Board](../ESP12/DIYDevBoard).

To compile the sources, two things to remember:

* When compiling `YouTubeControl`, use the `update_index_page.rb` script to regenerate the index page content if `page_design.html` has been modified (see discussion below for what this is)
* Copy `settings.h.template` to `settings.h` and fill in the WiFi access credentials before compiling (`settings.h` is excluded from the repository and is not shared).

Uploading the compiled application to the ESP8266 on the programming board:

### Button Tester Program

I used the [ButtonTester](./ButtonTester/ButtonTester.ino) sketch to verify that all foot switches and LEDs are working correcty
and can be controlled from the ESP8266.

With a laptop connected on the same wifi network as the footswitch, open the
web page [http://yt-foot-controller.local/](http://yt-foot-controller.local/).
It will reflect switch changes and the LED colours should match those indicated on the web page:

Here's a quick scratch video I recorded to check the behaviour:

All good!

### The YouTube Control Program

The [YouTubeControl](./YouTubeControl/YouTubeControl.ino) sketch combines button and LED control
with a web page and Javascript that implements the video control.

The javascript automation of YouTube is based on some earlier experiments from [Scripting YouTube](https://codingkata.tardate.com/javascript/scripting_youtube/).

Control Design - Buttons

| Button      | Action        | LED States |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| SW0 (left)  | skip back 10s | Normally off, flash green when skipping |
| SW1         | play/stop     | Red - stopped; green - playing          |
| SW2         | skip fwd 10s  | Normally off, flash green when skipping |
| SW3 (right) | mark/loop     | Normally off when no mark or loop. Green after first mark. Blue on 2nd mark and now looping |

How mark/loop works:

* first click: "marks" the start time of the loop
* next click: "marks" the end time of the loop. Video starts looping
* another click: cancels loop and clears the time markers

Status data packet is a hash containing:

* "uptime": long int; millis since startup (just FYI)
* "changed": bool; indicates of state has changed since last call
* "event": int;
  - indicates a single (most recent) action to take (missed actions are silently dropped)
  - 0: nothing to do
  - 1: start playing
  - 2: stop playing
  - 3: skip back
  - 4: skip fwd
  - 5: first mark
  - 6: second mark, start looping
  - 7: reset looping
* "play": bool; current play/stopped state
* "loop": bool; current loop state

For simplicity, the current page reloads the entire page when changing to a new video.
Reloading the main page causes a reset of the foot controller state to ensure everything stays in sync.

There is one slight annoyance - the YouTube API does not allow immediate automated control (as a defense against invasive autoplay dark patterns).
The work around is to require at least one click on the page before the foot switch can take over. A very minor inconvenience, but an extra click that I didn't really want.

I used a stand-along web page - [page_design.html](./YouTubeControl/page_design.html) - for mocking up the web page, styling and Javascript.
When I have it "just right", the page content is copied into [index_page.h](./YouTubeControl/index_page.h) for compilation.

NB: I used the [update_index_page.rb](./update_index_page.rb) script to reformat `page_design.html` and generate `index_page.h` automatically.

```
$ ./update_index_page.rb
Generating index_page.h from page_design.html...
...done!
```

### How it Works

### Adding Some Feet

I found some [Adhesive 6mm Silicon Pads](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000139088828.html).
They are very cheap and proved extremely effective.

No problems sticking to the wood without any additional adhesive, and they provide a high degree of grip,
stopping the unit sliding around under rough handling by foot.

### Improvements?

It's working just great, but some improvements I've been putting on a wishlist:

* I'm waiting for some non-slip pads to be delivered. This will stop the unit sliding around under rough handling by foot. DONEâˆš (see above)
* As mentioned above, I may replace the battery pack with a mains adapter and 3.3V regulator for extended playing sessions
* Add some more features to the web application, e.g.
  * maintain a playing history/library of vidoes
  * save and recall particular loop sections
