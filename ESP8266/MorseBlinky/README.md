# #342 MorseBlinky

Building code for an ESP-01 with the ESP8266 core for Arduino and demonstrate with a simple morse code blinker.

Here's a quick video showing it in action..

## Notes

The [ESP8266 core for Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
brings support for ESP8266 chip to the Arduino IDE.

That means being able to write C++ sketches for the ESP8266 as easy as developing for an Arduino.

This project is a quick test to see how it all works. Objectives are minimalist:

* using the most basic ESP8266 board: an ESP-01
* just blink the built-in LED with a morse code message

The [MorseBlinky.ino](./MorseBlinky.ino) sketch blinks a Morse code message on the built-in LED.

The sketch can be compiled unmodified for either an ESP8266 board or an Arduino.

There may be one difference required depending on the specific board: whether the built-in LED
uses active-high or active-low logic. Tthe specific ESP-01 board I have uses active-low logic,
whereas most Arduino boards I've seen use active-high.
This can be controlled with the `ACTIVE_LOW_LED_LOGIC` setting in the sketch.


### Programming Setup

I'm using a [LEAP#194 DIYDevBoard](../DIYDevBoard) to host the ESP-01 module,
and a cheap [CH340G-based USB to UART adapter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CH340-module-USB-to-TTL-CH340G-upgrade-download-a-small-wire-brush-plate-STC-microcontroller-board/32354359382.html).
With the
[correct drivers installed](../../notebook/arduino.md#arduinos-using-the-ch340g-serial-chip),
it shows up in the Arduino IDE ports list.


### Uploading a Sketch


Selecting the Generic ESP8266 board and correct port:

![board_settings](./assets/board_settings.png?raw=true)

The ESP8266 needs to be put into flash mode to accept the program upload:

* connect usb to dev board
* set flash mode dip switch
* power on the esp-01 (or toggle reset dip switch)
* arduino ide - click upload sketch

Note: this will of course wipe whatever image is already on the chip.

Here's the transcript of the programming step, performed by the [esptool.py](https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool) that is integrated in the [ESP8266 core for Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

```
Sketch uses 222161 bytes (51%) of program storage space. Maximum is 434160 bytes.
Global variables use 31528 bytes (38%) of dynamic memory, leaving 50392 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 81920 bytes.
