Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

I bought some [ESP-12E](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32339917567.html) ESP8266 modules a while back,
along with some [adapter boards](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649040259.html) but they've been sitting
in a drawer ever since. Time to crack them open!

These notes cover the basics of programming the devices with ESP8266 core for Arduino, using the Arduino IDE.

### ESP-12 Features

* 20 active pins
  * GPIO 0-15 all have a built-in pull-up resistor, just like in an Arduino.
  * GPIO16 has a built-in pull-down resistor.
  * GPIO2 has a built-in LED (may be on GPIO1 on other boards)
* 4Mib flash
* Requires 3.3V supply
* PCB trace antenna

## Construction

I'm using a breadboard layout with:

* the ESP-12 on an adapter board
* separate 3.3V power supply for the ESP
* CH340 USB to TTL adapter
* level-shifter for 5V signals to/from the USB to TTL adapter

## Demo Sketch

The [ESP12Programming.ino](./ESP12Programming.ino) sketch is a simple demonstration of GPIO input and output:

* button press (GPIO13)
* sequences output on GPIO 2, 4, 5, 12, 14, 16.

An LED bargraph module is used for display of the GPIO output.

### Programming with ESP8266 core for Arduino

My selected settings in the Arduino IDE:

![programming_settings](./assets/programming_settings.png?raw=true)

The adapter boards have fixed pull-up/down resistors included:

* 10k立 pull-down on GPIO15
* 10k立 pull-up on CH_PD

Externally (on the breadboard):

* 10k立 pull-up on RESET (with pushbotton to pull-down)
* 10k立 on GPIO0 (switchable as pullup/pull-down)

Programming mode is engaged by:

* set GPIO0 to pull-down
* toggle reset

Run mode is engaged by:

* set GPIO0 to pull-up
* toggle reset

Compile and push the code with the Arduino IDE:
