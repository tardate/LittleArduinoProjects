## Notes

Singapore is relatively progressive when it comes to radio spectrum allocation and use - for example, AM services disappeared by 2000 or so,
DAB came and went in 2011 (rendered irrelevant by Internet services and continued popularity of FM).
With the almost universal adoption of mobile and internet technology, the general perception is that shortwave and amateur radio are pretty much a thing of the past.
Singapore has an [amateur radio association (SARTS)](http://www.sarts.org.sg/) - which I am not a member of (yet).

So as I become more interested in RF, my first question is basic: so is there much activity, and if so, what modes and bands?

This document is going to be a work-in-progress. It comprises my notes on:

* frequency allocations and services
* personal observations i.e. signals I've actually been able to receive
* mainly shortwave and amateur bands


### IMDA Spectrum Allocation

The IMDA maintains allocations for amateur radio that are roughly in line with [ITU Region 3 guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_frequency_allocations#ITU_Region_3).
Excluded are bands at the low and high end: 2200m, 630m, 23cm.

## Shortwave Broadcast Services

The following is a personal log of shortwave broadcast services I have been able to receive in central Singapore.
