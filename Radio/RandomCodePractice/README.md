# #567 Random Code Practice

A simple Morse code practice generator that prints the character and sounds the dit-dahs to a speaker. Based on a project by Glen Popiel KW5GP.

Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

Glen Popiel's [Arduino for Ham Radio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23432504-arduino-for-ham-radio) is a great little collection
of ham radio-adjacent projects that not only provides some good project inspiration but also presents them in a way that
is easy to follow no matter one's level of Arduino experience.

This project is an adaptation/enhancement of a simple [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code) practice generator:

* it selects a random character
* displays the character on an LCD
* and sounds the Morse code to a piezo speaker
* the speed can be adjusted with a variable resistor

I've extended and revised the code to add some new features:

* a switch to select between all character / alpha only / numbers only
* display the actual dit-dah Morse representation on the screen as well as the character being sounded

## Construction

A SPDT Centre Off switch is used as a tri-state toggle for the character select:

* ON: pulled high (alpha only)
* CENTRE: VCC/2 voltage divider (all characters)
* OFF: pulled low (numbers only)

## Code & Libraries

* [Arduino Wire library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire)
* [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C) - LCD over IÂ²C
* Morse - Morse encoding by Erik Linder SM0RVV and Mark VandeWettering K6HX.
  - I cannot find a link to the original source (Version 0.2), so it is included in the project folder.
  - Includes Glen Popiel KW5GP's fixes for Morse encoding
  - extended by me to allow dynamic speed adjustment


## Putting it in a Box

For a final build, I switched the Uno for an Arduino Nano and mounted it all in a suitably sized chocolate box.
