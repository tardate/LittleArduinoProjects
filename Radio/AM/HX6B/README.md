## Notes

Just my notes on a build of [a HX-6B kit from a seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DIY-Kits-Superheterodyne-Radio-Receiver-6-Transistor-sch-case-w-Speaker/32367150788.html).

A superheterodyne receiver (often shortened to superhet) uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal
(at a variable frequency)
to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) which can be more conveniently processed with known gain and selectivity.

## Circuit Design

The HX6B is a superheterodyne design with a single IF stage. The design basically maps out as follows:

* RF Filter: T1, Ca antenna tuner
* RF amp: V1
* Local oscillator and Mixer: T2, Cb
* IF Filter and Amp: T3, V2
* Demodulator: T4, V3
* Audio amp: T5, V5, V6 push-pull class B
