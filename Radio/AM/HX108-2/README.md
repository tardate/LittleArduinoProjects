## Notes

AM/MW radios are of very little use these days in Singapore.
There is no local AM broadcasting, just a few stations from Indonesia and Malaysia that can be picked up if you're lucky.
However, there's still a great deal that can be learned from studying simple AM superheterodyne circuits.
I have built a similar kit before - the HX-6B, see [LEAP#123](../HX6B) - but I probably know more than I did then,
so I'm looking forward to this little opportunity to revisit similar ground.

Although it's possible to build the entire kit in under an hour, I decided to carefully follow a sub-system by sub-system
build from audio out to RF in. Co-incidentally, [K7QO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7CSitIbrMxj6jIldSWjJQg)
is posting an excellent series covering the build of an HX108-2 at the same time ... so I am heavily cribbing from there;-)

## Tutorials and Resources

The HX108-2 is a pretty popular kit, and a number of very good tutorials can be found on YouTube describing construction and tuning.
Here's a selection...

### K7QO HX108-2 AM Receiver: Theory and Construction

[K7QO](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7CSitIbrMxj6jIldSWjJQg/featured) had a series covering the build
that appears to have been subsequently re-cut into a series on RF Receivers. The main videos
covering this particular radio are part 6 and 7:

## The Kit

I purchased my [HX108-2 kit from seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/7-Tube-AM-Radio-Electronic-Kit-HX108-2-F5D4-DIY-Electronic-Set-Product-Accessory-Dropship-New/32953387145.html?spm=a2g0s.12269583.0.0.1bca1be39ujYzZ). It was generally OK, with no missing parts.
The only negative was that the speaker was somewhat corroded.

The basic specification for the kit:

* Frequency Range: 525-1605kHz
* Intermediate Frequency: 465kHz
* Output Power: 100mW
* Power Supply: 3V, 2xAA
* Speaker: 57mm diameter 8Ω

### Transistors

The transistors are classified by ß(hFE), and it seems many kits substitute different parts of similar capability:

* 9018G ß = 80-100
* 9018H ß = 97-146
* 9013H ß = 144-202

I stuck all the parts in a component testers, and found that
one of the 9013H had a much lower ß(hFE) than the others, so I replaced it from spare parts.
Might not have been necessary, but avoided a potential issue.

### Audio Transformers

There are two audio transformers used in the final stage:

* B6 input audio transformer (蓝 blue or 绿 green)
* B7 output audio transformer (黄 yellow or 红 red)

I received a 绿 green and 黄 yellow in my kit. For reference, I measured the resistance of each coil:

* 绿 green: 220Ω : 104Ω + 104Ω
* 黄 yellow: 2.5Ω : 6Ω + 6Ω

![kit_audio_transformers](./assets/kit_audio_transformers.jpg?raw=true)

### IF Transformers

There are four [transformer cans](https://www.electronics-tutorials.com/filters/if-amplifier-transformers.htm) used in the design:

* B2 红 red: local oscillator & mixer
* B3 黄 yellow: first IF
* B4 白 white: second IF
* B5 黑 black: demodulator

While not essential, I decided to tune the IF and demodulator cans to 465kHz prior to installation so they
should not require much fine tuning later.
Note: 455kHz is the conventional intermediate frequency, but the circuit states it is designed for 465kHz so I went with that.

I tuned the transformers with a 2V peak-peak 465kHz signal from a function generator directly connected to the 2-pin/single coil side
of the transformer, and monitored the output with an oscilloscope with the following results:

| Transformer | Initial Resonant Frequency | Tuned Resonant Frequency | Output Amplitude After Tuning |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| B3 黄 yellow| 455kHz                     | 465kHz                   | 21.6V                         |
| B4 白 white | 475kHz                     | 465kHz                   | 17V                           |
| B5 黑 black | 465kHz                     | 465kHz                   | 6.12V                         |

For B2 红 red, I simply measured its tuning  to make sure it was broadly in the ballpark. I'll fine tune it in-circuit:

| Transformer | Initial Resonant Frequency | Tuned Resonant Frequency | Output Amplitude After Tuning |
|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| B2 红 red   | 1455kHz                     | n/a                     | 11.3V                         |

#### PCB

The PCB has a reasonably good silk-screen to assist with construction:

![pcb_rear](./assets/pcb_rear.jpg?raw=true)

## Circuit Design

The schematic provided with the kit contains a number of errors. This is a copy that I have annotated with the necessary corrections:

![Schematic](./assets/HX108-2_schematic.jpg?raw=true)

The HX6B is a [superheterodyne receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superheterodyne_receiver) design with two IF stages.
The circuit basically maps to the following stages:

* RF Filter: B1, C1a antenna tuner
* RF amp: V1
* Local oscillator and Mixer: B2, C1b
* First IF Filter and Amp: B3, V2
* Second IF Filter and Amp: B4, V3
* Demodulator: B5, V4
* Audio amp:
  * V5 audio driver/preamplifier
  * B6, B7, V6, V7 push-pull class B power amplifier

A quick sketch from my notes on the functional design:

![HX108-2_functional](./assets/HX108-2_functional.jpg?raw=true)

### Test Points

The PCB includes a number of test points with a specified current range:

* V1 collector: 0.13-0.22mA
* V2 collector: 0.4-0.8mA
* V3 collector: 1-2mA
* V5 collector: 3-5mA
* B7 high-side: 4-10mA

I believe the way these test points should be used is as follows:

* build the complete circuit without bridging the test points
* power the circuit
* measure the current at each test point - it should be within the limits above
* after testing, bridge the test point

Since I'm going to build the circuit by stages, I don't think I'll be able to make these measurements as I go.
I could go back after the kit is complete and un-bridge and test each stage.

## Construction

### Step 1: Power

Can't achieve much without power! There are actually two "power rails" in the circuit:

* the full power of the battery is used to drive the audio amplifier
* and a ~1.4V rail is established using 2x diode drops to power the RF stages

| Ref | Item                                         | Installed |
|-----|----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| D1  | 1N4148                                       | √ |
| D2  | 1N4148                                       | √ |

| W   | switch and 5kΩ pot                           | √ |

Verification:

* with 3.15V applied (2xAA) the voltage at the anode of D1 measures 1.43V - this is as expected, about two diode drops of ~0.7V √
* the current drawn is about 7mA √. This is about right: [(3.15V-1.43V)/220Ω = 7.82mA](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(3.15V-1.43V)%2F220%CE%A9)

![step1](./assets/step1.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 2: Speaker and Battery

Mounting the speaker and battery clip in the housing.
Speaker is connected to the PCB, however I've left power disconnected for now as
I'll use a bench power supply for testing so I can read off total current and voltage.

![step2](./assets/step2.jpg?raw=true)

### Step 3: Audio

This step adds the audio pre-amp and power amplification stages, starting from C8/R9 - which is where I'll inject a test signal to verify things are working.
Note:

* C11 is mislabeled as C6 on the schematic (so I ended up installing both by accident)
* one of the 9013H tested with much lower ß(hFE) than the others, so I replaced it from spare parts. Might not have been necessary, but avoided a potential issue.

| V7  | 9013H                                        | √       |

![step3](./assets/step3.jpg?raw=true)
![step3-rear](./assets/step3-rear.jpg?raw=true)

Verification:

* powered with bench supply at 3V
* injecting a 0.4V peak-peak 1kHz sine wave at C8/R9 junction (CH1-Yellow in the scope traces below)

First, with the volume set to roughly 20%, total current drawn is about 40mA,
and the output (CH2-Blue) is amplified to about 1.55V peak-peak (gain ~ 3.9)

![step3-audio-out-40mA](./assets/step3-audio-out-40mA.gif?raw=true)

Next, with the volume set to roughly 60%, total current drawn is about 86mA,
and the output (CH2-Blue) is already clipping, running at about 4V peak-peak (gain ~ 10)

![step3-audio-out-86mA](./assets/step3-audio-out-86mA.gif?raw=true)

As I increase the volume, current peaks at about 120mA.
Interestingly, the current draw and volume does start to fall off at over say 80-90% on the volume control pot.
This probably indicates something in the push-pull configuration is starting to break down (but in a "safe" way).

### Step 4: Demodulator

The V4 transistor is being used as a detector in this stage.

![step4](./assets/step4.jpg?raw=true)

Verification:

* with circuit powered, probe the B5 test point - noise on the speakers √
* with circuit powered, inject 465kHz carrier with 1kHz AM via 22nF capacitor to the B5 test point - peaked 1kHz tone on the speakers √

## Step 8: Final Tuning and Testing

[shango066 has a great video on tuning the HX108-2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWtskDrjDgA?t=3271).

Since we don't have any AM stations in range, I did a rough manual alignment against some digital signals in the local MW band.
I read the frequency with a commercial radio, then adjusted the HX108-2 so that the signal appears at roughly the same frequency according to the front dial.

Since I'm tuning with an ugly digital signal, I can't really tell if the IF and demodulator stages are perfectly aligned, although they seem fine and couldn't be improved much with fiddling.
The main thing I needed to do was adjust the oscillator so that the frequency range roughly lines up with the decal/front dial.
I got "close enough for now" by just adjusting B2 红 red:

* set the variable capacitor to position the front dial at the expected frequency of the signal I was aiming for
* adjust B2 红 red until the signal is received at best strength/quality

## Conclusion

My local AM band is completely dead (has been for years) so now I have a perfectly functioning but absolutely useless doorstop;-)
But this has been great revision on simple superheterodyne receiver design.

Next steps?

* next time I travel to a place with AM, I might take it along for a test and some tuning in the field
* build a low-power AM transmitter for a little local area transmit/receive test
