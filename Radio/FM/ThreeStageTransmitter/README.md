# #281 FM/ThreeStageTransmitter

Build an "ugly-style in a can" version of dazaro3's 3-stage FM transmitter circuit.

## Notes

I got such good results with [LEAP#280 BreadboardTransmitter](../BreadboardTransmitter)
that I decided to make something more permanent than a breadboard.

Since I have some Altoids tins collecting dust for just such an occasion, I'm doing this "ugly-style in a can".

### Performance

In the initial circuit I have 33pF C4 in the tank circuit.
This produced a transmission frequency of 97.4MHz, which happens to be quite busy in my area.
After adding another 33pF C9 in parallel (effectively 66pF), I moved the transmission to a much clearer 79.8MHz.

Output power is very good - easily transmits around my house.
The microphone is very sensitive, and the pre-amp is fairly high gain. Loud sounds close to the microphone
can be quite distorted/clipped.

## Construction

Layout is derived from [LEAP#280 BreadboardTransmitter](../BreadboardTransmitter) design:

A strip of copper PCB is the positive rail anchoring the circuit:

Lots of space in the can for battery compartment, switch/LED/microphone attachments and the circuit itself.
The case provides the ground plane:

## The Real Deal

So after hacking away on [dazaro3's designs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5ca_ymxbKi9GqVH7BMxbg) I thought
I should get a "real" one as a way of saying thanks.

It just turned up, and works great. Happily I see the performance is very similar
to the builds I've done already. Here are some pictures:
