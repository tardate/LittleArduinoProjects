# #208 Single-stage FM Transmitter Kit

Build a simple single-stage FK702 FM Transmitter Kit by Future Kit.

## Notes

I've been experimenting with FM, and the hardest thing to get right tends to be the hand-wound coils.
So to get a baseline, I picked up a 1-transistor kit during a recent visit to Sim Lim Tower.

The kit is the FK702 by [Future Kit](http://futurekit.com/). It takes the hastle out of getting the LC circuit
right by printing the inductor coil on the PCB (used in conjuction with a trimmer capacitor).

### Power Connections

The PCB includes +9V and GND connectors.

### Optional Transmit-enable switch

The PCB includes connections for an optional transmit switch (not included).
I put a switch in my build.

### Performance

**tl;dr:** Not that great!

With the supplied coil antenna, I don't get much more than a metre range before the signal is lost to noise.

Adding 30cm rabbit ears gives about 5m.

Frequency is quite selective which is good, but stability is a bit all over the place - it will drift and jump over time.

Here's a trace of the signal and FFT when tuned at 83.25MHz:

Here's a quick demo..
