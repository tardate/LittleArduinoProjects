## Notes

The MLA-30+ Active Loop Antenna antenna is effective for reception across a wide frequency band from 500kHz to 30MHz.

I got mine from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007653379186.html) for SGD$30 (2025), but it is available from a range of sellers on aliexpress, eBay, and
[Tecsun Radios (AU)](https://www.tecsunradios.com.au/store/product/mla-30-shortwave-loop-antenna/).

## Mounting

The loop element of the antenna has a design diameter of 60cm and is connected to the active amplifier housing by two stainless steel wingnuts.

I used some 20mm PVC pip and fittings to mount the antenna.
