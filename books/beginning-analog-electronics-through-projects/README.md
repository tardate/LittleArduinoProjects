Analog electronics is the simplest way to start a fun, informative, learning program. Beginning Analog Electronics Through Projects, Second Edition was written with the needs of beginning hobbyists and students in mind. This revision of Andrew Singmin's popular Beginning Electronics Through Projects provides practical exercises, building techniques, and ideas for useful electronics projects. Additionally, it features new material on analog and digital electronics, and new projects for troubleshooting test equipment.

Published in the tradition of Beginning Electronics Through Projects and Beginning Digital Electronics Through Projects, this book limits theory to "need-to-know" information that will allow you to get started right away without complex math. Commonly used electronic components and their functions are described briefly in everyday terms. Ideal for progressive learning, each of the projects builds on the theory and component knowledge developed in earlier chapters. Step-by-step instructions facilitate one's learning of techniques for component identification, soldering, troubleshooting, and much more.

Includes instructions for using a general purpose assembly board
Practical, enjoyable, useful approach to learning about electronics
Features twelve easy and useful projects designed to familiarize beginners and hobbyists with the most commonly used ICs.
