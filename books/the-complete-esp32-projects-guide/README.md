The main aim of this book, entitled The Complete ESP32 Projects Guide, is to teach the Arduino IDE and MicroPython programming languages in ESP32-based projects, using Espressif’s highly popular ESP32-DevKitC development board. Many simple, basic and intermediate-level projects are provided in the book, using the Arduino IDE with ESP32-DevKitC. All projects have been tested and work perfectly fine. Block diagrams, circuit diagrams and complete program listings of all the projects are given along with explanations. In addition, several projects are provided for programming the ESP32 DevKitC with MicroPython. The projects provided in this book are designed to teach the following features of the ESP32 processor:

* GPIOs
* Touch sensors
* External interrupts
* Timer interrupts
* I²C and I²S
* SPI
* PWM
* ADC
* DAC
* UART
* Hall sensor
* Temperature sensor
* Infrared controller
* Reading and writing to SD card
* Reading and writing to flash memory
* RTC timer
* Chip ID
* Security and encryption
* Wi-Fi and network programming
* Bluetooth programming (Classic and BLE)
* Communication mobile devices
* Low-power design
* ESP-IDF programming

As the IoT specialist Jens Nickels says in a recent review: “[…] this book provides a comprehensive guide which (together with the component kit) I can highly recommend especially to beginners interested in measurement and control projects. It is also a good starting point for newcomers migrating from Arduino boards, such as the UNO, who want to get to know the more powerful ESP32 platform”.

The projects have been organized with increasing levels of difficulty. Readers are encouraged to tackle the projects in the given order. A specially prepared hardware kit is available from Elektor. With the help of this hardware, it should be easy and fun to build the projects of this book.

The writer of the book is Prof. Dogan Ibrahim, who has a BSc. in Electronic Engineering, an MSc. in Automatic-Control Engineering and a PhD in Digital Signal Processing. He has worked in many industrial organizations before returning to academic life. Prof. Ibrahim is the author of over 60 technical books and over 200 technical articles on microprocessors and related fields. He is a Chartered Electrical Engineer and a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering Technology.
