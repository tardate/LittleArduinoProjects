# #007 Programmable LED Arrays

## Notes

I bought some [WS2811-based LED Strips](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/IP68-12mm-WS2811-as-WS2801-led-pixel-module-IP68-waterproof-DC5V-full-color-RGB-50pcs-a/1932649085.html) with a specific project in mind. But first, need to get them working. Here are the first tests... all good so far!

* [RGBCalibrate](./RGBCalibrate) - quick test to make sure LEDs are correctly addressable and their color can be set correctly
* [StripTease](./StripTease) - demo a range of effects on the LED strip
* [AsyncLedStripEffects](./AsyncLedStripEffects) - timer-interrupt triggering of addressable LED array effects
