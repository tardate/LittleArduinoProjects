# #014 LED Array Async Effects

Demonstrates timer-interrupt triggering of addressable LED array effects using the [FlexiTimer2 library](https://github.com/wimleers/flexitimer2).

Here's a quick video of the demo:

## Notes

When running an animation sequence on an LED array, we don't want it upset by other processing on the Arduino.
This sketch uses the [FlexiTimer2 library](https://github.com/wimleers/flexitimer2) to drive the effect sequence from a timer interrupt.
That leaves the main loop() for doing other things.
