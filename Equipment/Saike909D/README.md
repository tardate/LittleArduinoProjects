## Notes

> you know what it's like when you go search for the cheapest hot-air station on the 11-11 sale; think well, I may as well get one of the better ones; and since the price not that much different I should go for the 3-in-1 instead of the 2-in-1, then have to sneak it home past your partner? ... well, like that :smiley:

I've been wanting a hot-air gun for a while, and I found a good deal on a Saike 909D recently.
It is actually a 3-in-1 unit, comprising:

* hot-air gun
* solder station
* DC power supply

It can usually be found sold with a bundle of supplies and attachments.

The TL/DR review: very good value for the price. Happy!

### Hot-air Gun

This is the main feature I bought the unit for .. and it works perfectly.
I grabbed a few faulty boards and was unmounting surface mount components within seconds.
The warm-up is very fast.

The only problem I encountered was with one of the nozzle attachments.
Poor quality construction - one of the adjustment lugs just fell off in my fingers:

The other nozzles are fine. Maybe I can get the seller to provide a replacement, but if not then no great loss.

### Power Supply

The built-in supply is very convenient to have on the bench built-in to the unit.
It comes with full set of probes and power connectors (including USB socket).

It can supply 0-15V at up to 1A:

* digital voltage display at 0.1V precision
* analog ammeter, 1A full scale. Of course not much use for mA circuits, but fine to highlight a large power drain.
* has an isolated floating ground. There is ~0mA leakage when grounded to earth.

It can also operate as a crude voltmeter.

A quick test:

#### Warning: Power OFf Flyback

One thing I've noted is a flyback surge when the main power is switched off.

The surge appears on the PSU outputs **regardless of whether the PSU is turned on or off**.

The actual spike is variable .. somewhere between -15V and +15V.

Here's an example of the voltage on the PSU output when the master switch is turned off (with the PSU itself turned off):

### Solder Station

I already have a "favourite iron", so the solder station is kind of an unnecessary bonus.

In my first test at 300°C I was having a hard time getting the solder to flow.
I thought it was either taking a very long time to warm up, or it was just unable to deliver sufficient power.

After a bit of research - finding

I suspect it is just not calibrated correctly.

I'll ask the seller before cracking the box to see if I can figure it out..
