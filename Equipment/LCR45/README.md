# #450 LCR45

Evaluating the Peak LCR45 inductance, capacitance and resistance meter.

![Build](./assets/LCR45_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

The LCR45 is one of the leading test instruments from [Peak Electronic Design](https://www.peakelec.co.uk/acatalog/peak-test-instruments.html) in the UK.

The LCR45 is specialised for high resolution inductance, capacitance and resistance measurement.
The main difference from the LCR40 is the 12 bit ADC and new software, resulting in greater range and resolution.

Features:

* Fluid measurements of L, C and R (continuous readings with selectable hold function).
* Fine resolution for improved performance at low inductance/capacitance/resistance.
* Auto and Manual component type.
* Auto and Manual test frequency.
* Frequencies: DC, 1kHz, 15kHz and 200kHz.
* Display of component values, complex impedance, complex admittance and magnitude/phase.

| Inductance Resolution   | 0.1µH |0.2uH  |  |


## Measuring Complex Impedance

The LCR45 measures [Complex Impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance#Complex_impedance) spanning the full
range of inductive, resistive and capacitive loads.

The main display will show Henries, Ohms or Farads as applicable, but the enter key switches the display to also show:

* complex impedence
* complex admittance (reciprocal of impedance)
* magnitude and phase

## Performance

The out-of-the box experience is excellent. It comes with a printed user manual (also available for download online, along with the datasheet),
but it really does not need much instruction. The fact that it is a compact, portable and battery-powered is a bonus.


Peak provide an option for the unit to be supplied with a certificate of conformance, which provides a detailed calibration and manual verification report.
I sprung for this option, as I lack any other calibrated LCR equipment.

One of the main applications I had for the unit was inductance measurement of hand-wound coils. I've no other equipment that can measure accurately
down into the µH range.

So far, so good. An excellent piece of equipment to have on hand.
