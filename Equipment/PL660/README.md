## Notes

I bought the Tecsun PL-660 from an aliexpress seller back in 2018 for SGD$150.30.
I mainly wanted it to monitor the HF/SW bands to cross-check and verify my various radio receiver projects.

The PL-660 is still available from [some aliexpress sellers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008076464823.html), however prices seem grossly inflated.
It may now be better to look at other models such as the [PL-330](https://www.tecsun-radios.com/product/pl330-radio-receiver/) if you are in the market for something like this.

For more detailson the PL-660, see the
[PL-660 Product Page](https://www.tecsun-radios.com/product/pl660-radio-receiver/)
and download the
[PL-660 Manual](https://www.tecsunradios.com.au/store/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PL-660-MANUAL.pdf).
