An ATmega328-based millivolt meter based on a design by Scullcom Hobby Electronics. Uses an LTC2400 ADC and LT1019 voltage reference.

I have fabricated the board at OSHPark, built and tested it - all OK! There are a few changes I'd make to the PCB if I did this again - mainly concerning more conventient connector placement. 

All the design notes (including code) are available at https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Equipment/MilliVoltmeterDIY/CustomBoardAndEnclosure
