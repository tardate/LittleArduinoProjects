# #274 Feeltech FY3200S

Testing out the Feeltech FY3200S digital function generator.

![FY3200S](./assets/FY3200S_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

Because you can never have too many function generators??!

* I have one built-into my oscilloscope, but that is only really practical if you want a fixed wave or are not using the scope at the same time
* I have built my own, and will probably build more, but it is nice to have a full-featured bit of kit as a benchmark for DIY

The Feeltech FY3200S gets some good reviews and was available at a very nice price. Some of the features that I was particularly interested in:

* linear and logarithmic frequency sweep function
* dual outputs
* broad range of waveform types, and also support for user-defined waveforms

The FY3200S is available with different upper frequency limits. I have the 24MHz version, sometimes listed as the FY3224S.

### Performance

In general it works great, especially the sweep function, here's a quick demo:

[![sweep](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jVyMcfEiMN0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyMcfEiMN0)

Only a few comments, not necessarily that negative:

* although billed as a 24MHz generator, and while it can achieve 24MHz, I see noticeable attenuation over 20MHz
* on power-on, it always starts up with a 10V sine wave. It would be nice if it restarted with previously-used settings.
* the control layout is a bit inconvenient:
    * if you use your right-hand, output coaxial cables get in the way when using the control knob
    * but if you use your left-hand on the control knob, you obscure the screen
* because the push-button controls are quite stiff, and the unit is so light, you are more likely to push the unit around instead of pushing a button! Find myself using two hands - one to hold the unit in place, the other to play with the controls. The feet seem to make the problem worse rather than better. Have to find a good place in the workspace desk where it won't go skitting around..

### Inside

The FY3200S comes in a nice instrument case, and inside is ... well, a lot of air really;-)

The unit essentially comprises three modules

* a switch-mode power supply
* USB/serial adapter
* mainboard and front-panel controller

### The Floating Ground Problem?

The unit does not have high-power requirements, but I presume it needs pretty clean power.
A simple switch-mode power supply does the job:

It is important to note that output connections are not earthed, but are instead floating by design.
Due to the suppression capacitor across input and output, this can mean the output ground floats significantly above earth ground.
A quick check of the "ground" on my FY3200S shows me it is running about +80V above earth.

This has been highlighted in a number of reviews such as [SDGMB #006 FeelTech FY3224S 24MHz Signal Generator Banggood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o5MzTOzZo4) by SDG Electronics.

Connecting the output ground to earth ground works fine, with any ground leakage below what I was able to measure (<10µA).

As some have pointed out, floating grounds may not be desirable in test equipment.
If desired, it is a relatively simple modification to permanently earth-ground the connectors (also entails changing the power socket and cord).

But either way - floating or earthed - it is always advisable to stop and think ground and power levels before interconnecting equipment.

#### Package List

|----|---------------------------|
|  1 | Function Signal Generator |
|  1 | USB Cable                 |
|  1 | Power Plug                |
|  1 | CD                        |
|  2 | BNC Clips Cable           |

The CD contains soft copy of the manual.

It also includes software for user-defined function generation/loading.
I haven't tried any of the software yet as it is all for Windows only.

There is, however, a copy of the FY3200S Series Communication Protocol Specification.
It defines a quite simple serial protocol that runs at 9600bps,
so it appears that it would be a relatively straight-forward task to write one's own
software to control the device.
