## Notes

I wanted another DMM for bench, and took a punt on the ANENG ANG860B+ Digital Multimeter.
It's available at a very nice price, and includes some more advanced features not always found on models in the same price range (µA, frequency, temperature).
It doesn't include transistor tester or inductance measurement (but I have other tools for this).

Thoughts after some initial testing:

* very nice display
* appears to be very accurate
* I don't like having the off switch on the measurement selection dial:
    * clunking it around every time to turn on the device is not very efficient, and I worry the switch selector will be the first thing to fail
    * I'd prefer a separate on/off switch, allowing the measurement selector to be left in the same position most of the time
