Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

I picked up a cheap [Metal Detector Kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000113983757.html) from an aliexpress seller for a few fairly prosaic reasons:

* it comes with an 18650 battery pack and I was interested in taking a look at the BMS provided
* it's a nice black PCB;-)
* .. and maybe I can use it as a stud finder/wiring detector in the house?


## The Kit

The kit comes in two parts:

* the metal detector circuit with USB connector. Working voltage: 3~5V
* 18650 battery pack and TP4333-based BMS module. Various colours are available for the batter case. It works well as a standalone 5V USB power pack.

Parts for the metal detector:

## Construction

The following is my re-drawing of the core metal detector circuit.
It is powered with 5V from the 18650/TP4333 battery module.

The circuit design is very similar to the [Metal Detector Module](https://protosupplies.com/product/metal-detector-module/) available from protosupplies.

## How the Detector Works

The detector comprises two inductor coils that are actually circular traces on opposite sides of the PCB.

* L1 in series with C1 (2.2nF) connects to the base of Q1 in parallel to a high-value base resistor R1 200kΩ
* L2 parallel with C2 (2.2nF) connects to the collector of Q1 and base of Q2
* L1 and L2 are wound in opposing directions
* VR1 potentiometer adjusts sensitivity by adjusting the resistance (voltage offset) at the Q1 emitter.

I think it basically works like this:
When a metallic (ferrous?) object is near the coils, the inductance rises and the resonant frequencies of the L1/C1 and L2/C2 tuned circuits changes.
Since L1 and L2 are in opposition, and oscillation can be sustained:

* L1/C1 turning on Q2
* Current flow through L2 will dampen L1 and throttle Q2

## The TP4333 BMS

The [TP4333](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/PMIC-Battery-Management_TPOWER-TP4333_C382128.html) module comes pre-assembled and snaps cleanly into the battery case.

![kit_bms_front](./assets/kit_bms_front.jpg?raw=true)
![kit_bms_rear](./assets/kit_bms_rear.jpg?raw=true)

This is the first time I've seen the TP4333. It's quite a capable little chip, combining charge control, protection and output boost converter:

* Discharge output: 5V/1A
* 1A output discharge efficiency up to 93%
* Charging current: 0.8A
* BAT discharge termination voltage: 2.85V
* Intelligent temperature control and over-temperature protection
* Integrated output overvoltage protection, short circuit protection, overload protection
* Integrated over-charge and over-discharge protection
* Supports trickle mode and zero voltage charging

The module appears to closely follow the typical application circuit from the datasheet. It doesn't use the flashlight output though.

Low battery protection:

* when the BAT voltage is greater than 3.2V on startup, the output boost circuit is enabled.
* if the battery voltage falls bellow 3.0V during operation, LED2 will flash at a frequency of 1Hz
* when the battery voltage falls bellow 2.85V, the discharge output is disabled and the TP4333 enters low-current standby mode

Load detection and low-power standby:

* When the load is connected, it is detected by the TP4333 detect and boost circuit enabled.
* When the load is disconnected, the boost circuit is disabled after an 18s delay, and the the TP4333 enters a low-current standby mode
