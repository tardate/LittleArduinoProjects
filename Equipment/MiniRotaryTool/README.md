## Notes

I found a good deal on a
[USB Cordless Rotary Tool Kit Woodworking Engraving Pen DIY For Jewelry Metal Glass Mini Wireless Drill](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004760381598.html) -from a seller on aliexpress.

I've wanted to try one of these for some time. For those cases where a Dremel, drill or router is just too heavy duty, for example:

* adding finishing details, cutouts etc for electronic project enclosures
* for scale model construction

The device arrived pretty much fully charged, so I was able to just slide in an attachment and start engraving.
Not powerful, but easy to precisely control, which is perfect for the light and fine work I plan to use it for.

### Specs

* Attachment: 2.35mm
* Clamp Depth: 25mm
* Speed: 10000-15000-20000rpm
* Power: 10W
* Voltage: 3.7V
* Battery capacity: 380MAH
* Charge input voltage: 5V 2A
