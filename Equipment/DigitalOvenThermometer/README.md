## Notes

I purchased the
[TS-BN55 Digital Display Electronic Thermometer](https://www.tokopedia.com/eskibike/ts-bn55-digital-display-0-300-electronic-thermometer-with)
some time ago. It appears to have been superseded by
[newer models](https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/32831844836.html)
that may have largely the same hardware but upgraded firmware (and perhaps a higher resolution LCD).

### Failure and Fix

It stopped working this Christmas. After opening it up, it was immediately apparent that the battery connection with had corroded through.
Replacing this was all that was required to get the unit working again. Good save - this unit was moments away from going in the bin!

No sign of life:

Pulling the circuit board makes it clear we have an issue with broken battery connector:

With battery connection repaired, the unit is back in action:
