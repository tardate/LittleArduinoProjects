## Notes

The [0-30V 2mA-3A Adjustable DC Regulated Power Supply DIY Kit](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1Set-Red-0-30V-2mA-3A-Continuously-Adjustable-DC-Regulated-Power-Supply-DIY-Kit-For-School/32789006670.html) is widely available from most hobby electronics markets (aliexpress, Banggood, eBay).

It features continuously variable output voltage, and a variable current limit with overcurrent indicator/shutdown.

It appears this design may have originated from [SmartKit](https://www.smartkit.gr/stabilised-power-supply-0-30v-3a-m.html) in Greece,
improved by [various people](http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/0-30-vdc-stabilized-power-supply-with-current-control-0-002-3-a/),
and at some point the "canonical design" was picked up for mass production (instantly identifiable by the red PCB and tall cap).

I'm certainly not the first to build the kit - it's a common project, just [search YouTube for 0-30V power supply](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=0-30V+power+supply) - for example this build by Boris Dusnoki:

## Construction

The board is an easy build. At this point I tested it to verify operation.
Note that it requires an AC supply to operate correctly.

![AdjustablePowerSupplyKit_base_build](./assets/AdjustablePowerSupplyKit_base_build.jpg?raw=true)


## How It Works

More information can be found in various places, such as:

* [electronics-lab.com](http://www.electronics-lab.com/project/0-30-vdc-stabilized-power-supply-with-current-control-0-002-3-a/)
* [Banggood](https://sea.banggood.com/0-30V-2mA-3A-Adjustable-DC-Regulated-Power-Supply-DIY-Kit-p-958308.html)

Here's a partial schematic of the main power supply circuit. I'll probably tidy and complete this later (e.g. it does not include the 24V fan power supply).

![core_schematic](./assets/core_schematic.jpg?raw=true)


## Enclosure and Additional Hardware


To trick this out as a finished bench power supply, I opted for the following:

A [6.7" x 5.1" x 3.1" Blue Metal Enclosure Project Case](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/6-7-x-5-1-x-3-1-Blue-Metal-Enclosure-Project-Case-DIY-Junction-Box/32825937652.html)

![kit_extras_enclosure](./assets/kit_extras_enclosure.jpg?raw=true)

Mains power supply via [fused socket and switch](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/NEW-HIGH-QUALITY-Red-Light-Power-Rocker-Switch-Fused-IEC-320-C14-Inlet-Power-Socket-Fuse/32801835266.html):

![kit_extras_fused_switch](./assets/kit_extras_fused_switch.jpg?raw=true)


A [15W, 24VAC step-down transformer](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/9VAC-0-9VAC-Output-Voltage-15W-EI-Ferrite-Core-Input-220V-50Hz-Vertical-Mount-Electric-Power/1695406839.html)

![kit_extras_transformer](./assets/kit_extras_transformer.jpg?raw=true)

A Volt/Ammeter display for the front panel. I've covered this component in detail in [LEAP#289 VoltmeterAmmeterModule](../../Electronics101/VoltmeterAmmeterModule)
It is powered from the 24V fan power supply, in parallel with the fan.

![kit_extras_voltammeter](./assets/kit_extras_voltammeter.jpg?raw=true)

I've mounted a [40mm  9 blade 24V fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/40mm-4cm-2-Pin-9-Blades-Computer-Chipset-Cooling-Fan-DC-24V/32852382945.html)
on the side of the unit, without any additional heat-sink on the main power transistor.
It turned out to be a noisy bugger.
My power requirements are minimal for now, I will proabbly re-assess in the future and make some temperature measurements under load.

![kit_extras_fan](./assets/kit_extras_fan.jpg?raw=true)

For the front panel power connectors, I've used a [nice dual banana binding post](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-Speaker-Amplifier-Dual-Binding-Post-Banana-Plug-Socket-Connectors-5pcs/32738527737.html).

![kit_extras_binding_post](./assets/kit_extras_binding_post.jpg?raw=true)


Finally a [metal bezel](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10pcs-3mm-LED-Emitting-Diode-Metal-Bezel-Holder-Round-Chrome-LED-Lamp-Base-with-10pcs-Plastic/32881242918.html)
for mounting the current-limit LED on the front panel

## Calibration

There are three calibration points for my build: zero volt offset for the regulator, and voltage/current adjustment for the panel meter.

The VR1 (blue pot) on the PCB is to zero the voltage offset of the power supply:

![calibration_zero_offset](./assets/calibration_zero_offset.jpg?raw=true)


The meter has adjustments for voltage and current on the rear of the unit.
With a 50Ω load (actually 49Ω according to my DMM), I'm reading 0.19A at 11.8V according to the panel meter.
The voltage is spot on, but the current is off from the expected [~0.23A](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=11.8V%2F49%CE%A9),
and I later made the adjustment to get this within 10mA of actual.

![calibration_voltammeter](./assets/calibration_voltammeter.jpg?raw=true)


## Over-current Test

The current-limit setting (blue knob in my build) works as expected. When current limit is exceeded, the output shuts off:

![AdjustablePowerSupplyKit_test_overcurrent](./assets/AdjustablePowerSupplyKit_test_overcurrent.jpg?raw=true)


## Final Comments

This is a nice kit and a fun build, but a couple of draw-backs:

* the voltage output is only as accurate as your meter, and fine adjustment is tricky. I've seen build variations that include course and fine voltage adjustments; this would be a good variation on the build (two pots or large and small resistance in series would work fine)
* the current-limiting feature works well, but suffers from the fact that there is no feedback on what the setting is (without tripping it to test.
* the fan is a very noisy heat-management solution - my own fault for selecting the fan I did. I would be interested in seeing how much power the unit could handle with heatsink alone.


All in all, a good general purpose power supply for the bench, especially where voltage/current limits do not have to be extremely precise.
I think I still prefer my DPS-3005-based power supply as a more accurate and featured solution - see [LEAP#407 DPS3005BenchPowerSupply](../DPS3005BenchPowerSupply) for more on that project.
