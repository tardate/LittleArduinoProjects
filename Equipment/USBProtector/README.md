# #400 USBProtector

Building the Silicon Chip USB Protector which demonstrates various methods of reverse-polarity, over-voltage and over-current protection.

## Notes

I picked up the Silicon Chip USB Protector not so much because of need, but because it is an interesting study
in a range of over-voltage and over-current protection mechanisms.

The project is written up in Silicon Chip May 2018 (p57), with the [kit and supporting materials available online](http://www.siliconchip.com.au/Shop/20/4574).

I just saw [μArt](https://www.crowdsupply.com/pylo/muart) on crowdsupply, which is an interesting
project with similar protection mechanims but intended for UART applications.

[ARRL Hands-on Radio (Vol 2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198290-arrl-s-hands-on-radio-experiments-volume-2) also has good coverage of these topics. See:

## Circuit Description

I made a quick [transcription of the circuit in EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/tardate/usb-protector) for the purpose of getting a little more
intimate with the circuit.

![Schematic](./assets/USBProtector_schematic.png?raw=true)


At it's core, the circuit is a pass-through of the USB power, ground and two data lines (D+, D-).
It then adds the following protection mechanisms:

| Component(s) | Protects             | Description                                                                                                       |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PTC1         | Vcc over-current     | Resetable, handling moderate over-current without needing replacement                                             |
| Fuse         | Vcc over-current     | Reacts faster to very high currents than PTC                                                                      |
| D3           | Vcc reverse polarity | Limits Vcc to -0.55V. Potects PC-side from peripheral-side reverse voltage which should cause PTC or fuse to trip |
| Q1, REF1     | Vcc clamp            | Active protection from  over-voltage that may not trigger over-current. Reaction time relative slow               |
| TVS1         | Vcc clamp            | Passive over-voltage protection that is also fast-acting                                                          |
| D1,D2        | D+/D- clamp          | Over-voltage and reverse-voltage clamping for data lines                                                          |
| TVS1         | D+/D- clamp          | Transient voltage supressor for data lines                                                                        |


The circuit includes two LED indicators:

* LED1 is simple power indicator, always on when Vcc powered
* LED2 turns on proportionally to the degree of voltage clamping being applied

## Construction

The kit primarily uses SMD components, but reasonably large packages and not too cramped so I decided to hand-solder rather than bust out the hot air.
the parts are conveniently provided taped up and labeled on a sheet or paper:

The PCB had one error in the silk-screen. The lower component marked "10k" is in fact the 47kΩ resistor between Q1 and Q2.

![pcb_rear](./assets/pcb_rear.jpg?raw=true)

Recommended construction order:

* top-side components:
    * Q1
    * TVS1, next to Q1
    * SMD passive components
    * REF1 and Q2
    * LEDs
    * D3
* bottom-side components:
    * D1, D2
    * TVS2
    * F1
* USB plug and socket
