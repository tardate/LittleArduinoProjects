## Notes

A [Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_analyzer_(electrical)) is a powerful instrument used to measure the electrical characteristics of radio frequency (RF) and microwave components. It evaluates how signals behave in a network by analyzing parameters such as reflection (S11) and transmission (S21), commonly referred to as S-parameters. Engineers and hobbyists use VNAs to design, test, and troubleshoot antennas, filters, cables, and other RF devices by providing detailed insights into impedance, return loss, and signal behavior across a range of frequencies.

The [NanoVNA](https://nanovna.com/) is a compact, low-cost, open-source VNA that has gained popularity among electronics enthusiasts, amateur radio operators, and engineers for its affordability and portability. Despite its small size, it offers surprisingly capable performance, making it ideal for basic RF measurements in the field or lab. The NanoVNA allows users to visualize data in real time on a built-in screen or via PC software, making it a practical entry point into the world of RF testing and analysis.

### The NanoVNA

I purchased the
["NanoVNA-H 50KHz~1.5GHz VNA 2.8inch LCDHF VHF UHF UV Vector Network Analyzer Antenna Analyzer" from a seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000340610778.html)
currently listed for SG$118.30 (was $57.99 when I purchased in 2020).

### Charging

With USB cable attached

* red LED fast flash during battery charge.
* red LED slow flash when charged

### Calibration

First, calibrate as follows.

* Make sure START is 50kHz
* Make sure STOP is 900MHz
* Calibrate according to the [calibration method](https://nanovna.com/?page_id=2)
    * choose `CAL` from the main menu
    * choose `RESET`
    * choose `CALIBRATE`
    * connect the open standard to S11, press `OPEN`
    * connect the short standard to S11, press `SHORT`
    * connect the load standard to S11, press `LOAD`
    * connect the load standard to S21, press `ISOLN`
    * connect cable from S11 to S21, press `THRU`
    * press `DONE`

### NanoVNASaver

[NanoVNASaver](https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver) is an open source multiplatform tool to save Touchstone files from the NanoVNA,
sweep frequency spans in segments to gain more than 101 data points, and generally display and analyze the resulting data.

I am running macOS as my main machine. There are various ways to install NanoVNASaver, this is the one that worked without any issues:

I used pyenv to install python 3.12.9 (older than the main versions I run). NanoVNASaver appears to still require versions before 3.13.

First created a virtual environment (in a folder named `venv`) and install the latest source using pip:

    $ pyenv shell 3.12.9
    $ python --version
    Python 3.12.9
    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver/archive/refs/tags/v0.5.5.tar.gz

Once installed, the virtual environment just needs to be activated before running the app:

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ NanoVNASaver
    NanoVNASaver 0.5.5

Here's a quick test with a 100ÂµH choke on S11:
