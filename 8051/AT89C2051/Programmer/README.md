# #394 AT89C2051 Programmer

Building a programmer for the Intel MCS-51/8051 compatible AT89C2051, with host software running on MacOSX.

## Notes

I've been meaning to dive a bit deeper into
[Intel MCS-51/8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_MCS-51) devices and programming
ever since I built the [LEAP#088 ElectronicClockKit](https://leap.tardate.com/8051/electronicclockkit/).
While it's long been EOL at Intel, [this article By Jon Wilder](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/intels-mcs-51-microcontroller-family-stay/)
is a valiant argument for why they are still around.

I have some (still in production) [AT89C2051](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/AT89c2051) chips -
but before I can do much more, I need a programmer.

Reading the AT89C2051 datasheet, its seems programming is actually a quite straight-forward process - the only complication
being the need for a 12V programming voltage in addition to standard logic high of ~5V.

So while I could go out and buy a programmer, the idea of building my own is very attractive for two reasons:

* it is a bit of a short cut to building familiarity with the chip and datasheet
* I can make sure it supports my host platform of choice - MacOSX

### Inspirations and Prior Art

I found a couple of interesting projects that provided a good starting point.
I'd recommend checking these out. In summary:

1. [AT89C2051_programmer](https://github.com/piotrb5e3/AT89C2051_programmer)
    * by [piotrb5e3](https://github.com/piotrb5e3)
    * uses separate 12V programming voltage power supply [**negative**]
    * open source python host programming software distributed via PyPI (at89overlord) [**positive**]
    * uses Arduino Uno as a programmer [**positive**]

2. [An Arduino-based programmer for the AT89C2051 chip](http://ceptimus.co.uk/?p=216)
    * by [ceptimus](http://ceptimus.co.uk/)
    * uses a charge pump for 12V programming voltage [**positive**]
    * charge pump control is quite naive (bit-banging) [**negative**]
    * C# host programming software, open sourced but not in collaborative version control [**negative**]
    * uses Arduino as a programmer [**positive**]
    * quite wasteful of GPIO pins, so requires Arduino Mega/ATmega2560 [**negative**]

Boiling down my wishlist/plan:

* use an Arduino-controlled charge pump for programming voltage, but control it with PMW similar to [LEAP#392 Dickson Charge Pump](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/dicksonchargepump/)
* assign GPIO pins judiciously so can still use Arduino Uno/ATmega328 as the programmer
* base the Arduino programming sketch on piotrb5e3's, but modified for charge pump control
* hopefully maintain compatibility with at89overlord so it can be used as the host programming software, else adapt as required

## VPP/RST Power Control

We need to switch between 12V, 5V and 0V on the VPP/RST pin for the range of programming modes.
From the datasheet

* VPP Programming Enable Voltage: 12V ± 0.5V (programming current is only 250µA)
* for HIGH with 5V supply: actually require 0.7 * VCC i.e. 3.5V minimum
* for LOW: actually require 0.2 * VCC - 0.1V i.e 0.9V maximum

My goal was to achieve this with as few Arduino pins as possible, and without requiring an external 12V power supply.
I can't find the specs, but I'm pretty sure we need negligible current/power at any of these levels, which simplifies things.

I finally figured out this scheme. It needs 3 Arduino pins:

* ~16V charge pump, generated with 62kHz PWM from 2 pins (inverted pair of PWM waves)
    * the output is fed to VPP/RST after clamping with a 12V zener diode
* 0/5V controlled with a digital pin:
    * 5V is connected to VPP/RST via a diode to prevent 12V appearing back on the Arduino pin
    * 0V signal is inverted via a pair of NPN transistors that pull the VPP/RST down hard
    * this avoids ~2V from the unexcited charge pump preventing a true 0V input

And it works;-)

There is one caveat: there's an "invalid state" that must be avoided lest the magic smoke may be released in a possible high current/burnout.
This is avoided in the programming software.

Here's a breakdown of the control states. In this table:

* RST_PIN - pin A0 output
* Charge Pump PWM - pins 3,11 output

| RST_PIN  | Charge Pump PWM | Charge Pump Voltage | Q1c  | Q2  | VPP/RST       |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|------|-----|---------------|
| High, 5V | On              | 12V                 | Low  | Off | ~12V          |
| Low, 0V  | On              | 12V                 | High | On  | invalid state |
| High, 5V | Off             | ~2V                 | Low  | Off | ~4.4V         |
| Low, 0V  | Off             | ~2V                 | High | On  | ~0V           |

Possible improvement: I could probably reduce this to requiring 2 pins in total with the addition of an inverter IC to:

* invert a single PWM signal for charge pump control
* replace the 2 x NPN inverter for the 0V pull-down

## Installing at89overlord

Using a Python3 virtual environment. Requirements are in `requirements.txt`

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs at89overlord 0.4.0 (there was
[a minor issue](https://github.com/piotrb5e3/AT89C2051_programmer/issues/2)
with the packaging of 0.3.0 that may cause problems; 0.4.0 works fine though)

## Programming a Device

On my system, I have the Arduino plugged in and appearing on `/dev/tty.usbmodem14511`.

Using the hex file generated with the [LEAP#394 AT89C2051 Blinky code here](https://leap.tardate.com/8051/at89c2051/blinky/), programming a chip is as simple as this:

```sh
$ at89overlord -p /dev/tty.usbmodem14511 -f ../Blinky/Blinky.hex
# Initializing the programmer...
# Initialized!
# Confirming chip ID...
# Confirmed!
# Erasing flash...
# Done!
# Writing flash...
# Done!
# Verifying...
# Done!
```

## Putting it on a Prototyping Shield

With so many wires on the breadboard, this is not very practical to build every time I need to program an 8051,
and it is pretty fragile - just one dodgy wire and programming/verification can easily fail.

It looks like a nice project to build a custom board, with ATmega328 built in ... another project for later!

I have a spare prototyping shield for an Uno, so for now I've put the circuit on that.
Here's a sketch of the layout I used:

The finished shield:

Now it's easy to program an AT89C2051..
