Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

The 7-segment display unit I have is stamped "SMA42056". It appears to be fairly common, however I've yet to find a datasheet for it.
From inspection hwoever, it's clearly a common cathode unit, and similar to the
the [SC56-11](../assets/SC56-11_datasheet.pdf?raw=true)

There are two common cathode pins, but since these are internally connected there is no need to connect both to ground.
Lighting a segment simply means providing a driving voltage to the corresponding anode pin.

This circuit puts the resistors in series of the anode pins. This ensures a consistent brightness no matter how many segments are on. Note that it is possible to put the current-limiting resistor on the common cathode;
this is a bit of an approximation and will lead to varying LED brightness but may be "good enough" depending on your application.

### Pin-Segment Mapping

Here's a summary of how the Arduino pins are mapped to LED segments:

| Pin | Segment                    |
|-----|----------------------------|
|  2  |  A - top horizontal        |
|  3  |  B - top right vertical    |
|  4  |  C - bottom right vertical |
|  5  |  D - bottom horizontal     |
|  6  |  E - bottom left vertical  |
|  7  |  F - top left vertical     |
|  8  |  G - center  horizontal    |
|  9  |  dp - decimal point        |
