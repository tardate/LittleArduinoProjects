# #177 7-Segment Shift Drive

Test control of a 7-segment LED display via a 74HC595 shift register.

Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

While you can wire up each segment pin to a digital out on the Arduino as in the
[LED7Segment/DirectDrive](../DirectDrive) project, it soon becomes pretty wasteful of pins.
This project uses a 74HC595 8-bit shift register to feed segment values, requiring only 3 pins.

Since the 74HC595 has latched outputs, it also means all segment changes are simulataneous.

### Register-Pin Mapping

Here's a summary of how the bits in the shift register are mapped to LED segments:

| Bit | Segment                    |
|-----|----------------------------|
|  0  |  A - top horizontal        |
|  1  |  B - top right vertical    |
|  2  |  C - bottom right vertical |
|  3  |  D - bottom horizontal     |
|  4  |  E - bottom left vertical  |
|  5  |  F - top left vertical     |
|  6  |  G - center  horizontal    |
|  7  |  dp - decimal point        |

However the [code](./ShiftDriveSPI.ino) uses bytes to represent dp,G,F..A from MSB to LSB,
so I use MSBFIRST transfer.
