Blinks a series of 12 LEDs in a continuous loop.

## Notes

There seems to a general mis-conception that resistors should be connected to the
anode of a LED: [not true](http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/13746/why-does-a-resistor-need-to-be-on-the-anode-of-an-led).

This circuit simplifies things with a single resistor (1k is about right for the LEDs I used) on the common
cathode part of the circuit. That's fine in this case because we're only going to have one LED on at any time.
