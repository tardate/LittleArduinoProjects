## Notes

See the [AvrHardwarePWM](../) project for all about hardware PWM with the Arduino UNO/ATmega328.

This project takes the same background and exercises hardware PWM with an ATtiny85 processor.

### ATtiny Timers

There are two timers in the ATtiny85 that can be used to generate PWM signals:

* Timer 0 is an 8-bit timer. capable of phase correct and Fast PWM (similar to the ATmega). It is used for functions such as delay() and millis() - these will be affected if PWM frequency is changed.
* Timer 1 is an 8-bit timer, capable of two Fast PWM outputs. It acts as an up-counter, with TOP defined by OCR1C. It also with complementary outputs.


| Compare Register | Timer output               | Chip pin | Pin name  |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------|-----------|
| OCR0A            | OC0A                       | 5        | PB0       |
| OCR0B            | OC0B                       | 6        | PB1       |
| OCR1A            | OC1A                       | 6        | PB1       |
| OCR1B            | OC1B                       | 3        | PB4       |
| OCR1A            | OC1A, complementary output | 5        | PB0       |
| OCR1B            | OC1B, complementary output | 2        | PB3       |

NB:
* the chip pin references are for the PDIP/SOIC/TSSOP package.

### How Fast is the Clock?

The ATtiny85 can use an external clock, but by default it uses an internal oscillator.
The internal oscillator runs at 8 MHz, prescaled to 1 MHz by default.

The clock settings are in the fuses. I used avrdude to read the fuses:

```
$ avrdude -c stk500v1 -p attiny85 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem14521 -b 19200 -U lfuse:r:-:i

avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.05s

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e930b (probably t85)
avrdude: reading lfuse memory:

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.02s

avrdude: writing output file "<stdout>"
:01000000629D
:00000001FF

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:62)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

The [engbedded fusecalc](http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc) site is invaluable for decoding or calculating fuses values.

It confirms that E:FF, H:DF, L:62 are factory defaults: 8 MHz internal oscillator with CKDIV8 prescaler: so it is running at 1 MHz.


### Example Sketch

[ATtiny.ino](./ATtiny.ino) exercises the PWM modes, primarily so they can be captured
with an oscilloscope. The push-button attached to pin 7 is used to cycle through a few demonstration modes.

The demonstration modes are not exhaustive, but show off most of the PWM capabilities.

I'm using consistent scope connections in all examples:

| Timer output               | Chip pin | Pin name  | Scope Channel |
|----------------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| OC0A                       | 5        | PB0       | 2 (blue)      |
| OC0B                       | 6        | PB1       | 1 (yellow)    |
| OC1A                       | 6        | PB1       | 1 (yellow)    |
| OC1B                       | 3        | PB4       | 3 (red)       |
| OC1A, complementary output | 5        | PB0       | 2 (blue)      |
| OC1B, complementary output | 2        | PB3       | 4 (green)     |
