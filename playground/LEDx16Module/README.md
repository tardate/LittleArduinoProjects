# #179 LEDx16Module

A custom 16 LED SMD PCB with 74HC595 shift register interface.

Here's a quick video of the module running the demo code:

## Notes

This is my version of project 3 from the
[KiCad like a Pro](http://txplore.tv/courses/kicad-pro)
course from Tech Explorations.

The board exposes a dual 74HC595 shift register interface for microcontroller control
of an array of 16 LEDs with current-limiting resistors.

The PCB design was done with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).

I haven't sent the boards for production yet - first sourcing and verifying the SMD components.
When I've built and tested the board, I'll update and share the OSH Park project and Arduino code.

I sent these off for production at [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/E2aHiqP5), and they turned out quite well.
I think I could have picked a footprint for the SOP16 ships with longer pads to make them easier to solder by hand.

One variation I've made in the circuit from the KiCad like a Pro course:
I've explicitly grounded pin 13 (output enable - active low).
If left floating, I've found the circuit to be unreliable depending on power conditions (output enable floats high).

## Construction

See the [KiCad project](./kicad_project/LEDx16Module.pro) for all the details. Here's the result:

## Demo

The [LEDx16Module.ino](./LEDx16Module.ino) sketch runs a simple demo sequence on the board from an Aurduino using hardware SPI.
