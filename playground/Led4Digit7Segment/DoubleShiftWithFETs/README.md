# #081 4x7-Segment Double Shift With FETs

Driving a 4-Digit 7-Segment LED display with only 3 pins, using two 74HC595 shift registers and some n-channel FETs

## Notes

This circuit is a variation of the [DoubleShift](../DoubleShift) experiment that
demonstrated how to use two 74HC595 shift registers and some NPN BJTs to drive a 4-digit 7-segment display with
only 3 Arduino GPIO pins.

The only difference here is that the S9013 NPN BJTs are replaced with 2N7000 n-channel FETs.

When fully on (e.g. displaying 8888), it appears the display and associated components on the breadboard are drawing
an average of about 2.47mA (compared to 2.87mA with BJTs).
