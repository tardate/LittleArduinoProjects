# #148 AD9833 Basic Demo Cycle

Run a basic waveform demo with an AD9833 module

![The Build](./assets/BasicDemoCycle_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

I bought an
[AD9833 module from a seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/E74-Free-Shipping-Programmable-Microprocessors-AD9833-Sine-Square-Wave-DDS-Signal-Generator-Module/32436878279.html)
with the intention of using it to build a function generator to add to my collection of test gear.

This project is a first test to explore:

* the SPI protocol it supports
* different waveforms it can produce
* controlling the frequency

Conclusion:

* once you get the SPI configuration correct, it works extremely well, and is very easy to control.
* accuracy at frequencies under 1MHz or so is very good
* accuracy over 1MHz inconclusive .. I need to do some more testing

### Module Interface

Here's the module, with pins attached (with my imperfect soldering, so don't blame the manufacturer!):

![module front](./assets/module_front.jpg?raw=true)

![module rear](./assets/module_rear.jpg?raw=true)

The labeling of the pins is a bit unusual. Here's the pin definition, and how they connect to an Arduino Uno for hardware SPI:

| Pin    | Usage                 | Arduino SPI Pin |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| VCC    | 2.3V to 5.5V          |                 |
| DGND   | digital ground        |                 |
| SDATA  | SPI data (MOSI)       | 11 MOSI         |
| SCLK   | SPI clock             | 13 SCK          |
| FSYNC  | SPI slave select (SS) | 10 SS           |
| AGND   | analog ground         |                 |
| OUT    | output signal         |                 |

NB: the "analog ground" is internally linked to "digital ground" according to the circuit diagram for the module.

### SPI Specifics

The module operates in SPI_MODE2 with MSBFIRST:

* data shifted on falling edge
* FSYNC pin is active low,
* accepts the most significant bit (MSB) of each transfer first.
* The SCLK pin is also specified to be kept high when not in use

### Waveform demo

The [BasicDemoCycle.ino](./BasicDemoCycle.ino) script is a simple non-interactive demo that runs through the different waveforms.

It uses the new SPI.beginTransaction/SPI.endTransaction syntax, although since the script only works with one SPI device,
it is redundant to wrap each command sequence in a transaction. But it is a good test of the "right way to do it".
NB: many other scripts found on the net pre-date this syntax.

It is running at very low frequencies in order to produce a visual demo. It sends the measure waveform to the serial port.
[LEAP#090 PlotNValues (a simple Processing sketch)](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/plotnvalues/) reads the data from the serial port and plots the output value over time, with some coloration effects thrown in for good measure.

Here's a sample trace. It shows a few cycles of each waveform. From the left:

* sine wave
* square wave (normal cycle time)
* triangle wave
* square wave (halved cycle time i.e. twice as fast)
* output off

Note that square waves are rail-to-rail, since they bypass the DAC. Other waveforms peak at 0.65V per the datasheet.

### Frequency Accuracy?

A few quick measurements with a frequency counter gave very good results under a few MHz.
But when I started pushing into the 6-12.5MHz realm, accuracy appeared to drop off markedly.

This may simply be the influence of running the module on a breadboard. I should try it on a PCB.

For now, here are some results (AC-coupled scope traces) with a sinusoid waveform in the breadboard layout.

At 1MHz, still a decent output:

By 8MHz, the waveform is quite distorted and unstable but still on frequency:

By 12MHz, it has devolved to a heavily-modulated mess:

## Construction

NB: I created a
[custom Fritzing Part available here](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/FritzingParts/AD9833_Module) for these diagrams.

Running at 300kHz, pretty accurate!
