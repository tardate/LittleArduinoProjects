# #236 AudioDSP/Boost

AudioDSP boost effect based on the pedalSHIELD.

## Notes

[Boost.ino](./Boost.ino) is a simple clean boost/volume control example from the pedalSHIELD examples.
The pushbuttons control the output volume up and down.

Core algorithm:

* the main loop sets the effect on/off indicator (LED on pin 13)
* input read/output write is handled in the Timer 1 interrupt service routine


### AudioDspDriver Library

This example uses a private [AudioDspDriver](../../../libraries/AudioDspDriver) library
that contains my refactoring of the core algorithms for driving the board.
I may split this out as a stand-alone library at some point.
