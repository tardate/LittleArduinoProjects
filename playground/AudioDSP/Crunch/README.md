# #238 AudioDSP/Crunch

AudioDSP crunchy distortion effect based on the pedalSHIELD.

## Notes

[Crunch.ino](./Crunch.ino) is a crunchy distortion effect from the pedalSHIELD examples.
The pushbuttons control the volume of the output signal.

Core algorithm:

* distortion is derived from an asymmetrical clipping system based on Schetzen formula

### Performance

Not so great. The asymmetrical algorithm results in a fat bottom end but some annoying high-frequency distortion.

See [SuperCrunch](../SuperCrunch) for the symmetrical version, which is much more pleasing.

### AudioDspDriver Library

This example uses a private [AudioDspDriver](../../../libraries/AudioDspDriver) library
that contains my refactoring of the core algorithms for driving the board.
I may split this out as a stand-alone library at some point.
