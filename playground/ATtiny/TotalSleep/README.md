# #128 ATtiny TotalSleep

Test a total power shutdown with an ATtiny85 processor on a breadboard.

Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

The [ATtiny SleepMode](../SleepMode) project showed me that even in CPU sleep mode, an ATtiny85 circuit can
still draw something in the order of 238µA.

This project tests a scheme for total power shutdown triggered by the microcontroller itself.
The circuit then draws virtually no current (certainly less than 10µA - the resolution of the ammeter I was using in-circuit).

The trade-off is that the circuit requires an external trigger to wake-up again. Here it uses a push-button.

How it works:

* power is supplied to the ATtiny and other circuit elements through a p-channel MOSFET (I'm using a BS250 here)
* when power is turned on, the 1MΩ resistor charges the 100nF capacitor with a time constant of [100ms](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1M%CE%A9*100nF)
* this keeps the FET Vgs negative long enough for the ATtiny to power up and apply a high signal to the base of the NPN transistor
* the NPN collector-emitter conduction holds the FET Vgs negative, and therefore "powered on"
* when the ATtiny wants to power-down, it brings the NPN base low, cutting the collector-emitter channel, and sending the FET Vgs to 0V.
* this turns off the FET and everything is powered down. The current drawn in this state is limited to leakage of the components
* to powerup, the push-button shorts the capacitor, bringing the FET Vgs down and setting the cycle off again

This all seems to work very reliably.
