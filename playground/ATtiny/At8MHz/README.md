# #275 ATtiny at 8MHz

How to run an ATtiny85 microprocessor at 8MHz using the internal clock.

![Build](./assets/At8MHz_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

The ATtiny85 runs at 1MHz by default. This project demonstrates how to run it
at 8MHz while still using the internal oscillator.

To communicate with the ATtiny, I am using:

* avrdude from MacOSX
* an Arduino Uno running the ArduinoISP programmer sketch as documented in [LEAP#070 ProgrammingWithArduinoISP](../ProgrammingWithArduinoISP)
* the [LEAP#253 ProgrammingShield](../ProgrammingShield) to mount the ATtiny85 on the Arduino for programming

### The 8MHz Internal Clock Configuration

8MHz operation is achieved with fuse settings for:

* internal 8 MHz RC oscillator (CKSEL=0010)
* no prescaler (CKDIV8=0)

Two easy techniques for setting the fuses appropriately are shown below:

* use the Arduino IDE (which uses avrdude under the covers)
* use avrdude directly


### Checking the Configuration

The ATtiny85 can use an external clock, but by default it uses an internal oscillator.
The internal oscillator runs at 8 MHz, prescaled to 1 MHz by default.

The clock settings are in the fuses. I used avrdude to read the fuses:

```
$ avrdude -c stk500v1 -p attiny85 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem14521 -b 19200 -U lfuse:r:-:i

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

The [engbedded fusecalc](http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc) site is invaluable for decoding or calculating fuses values.

It confirms that E:FF, H:DF, L:62 are factory defaults: 8 MHz internal oscillator with CKDIV8 prescaler: so it is running at 1 MHz.


### Setting the fuses with the Arduino IDE

When using an Arduino as the in-system programmer, the Arduino IDE can be used to burn the correct fuse settings.
This is too easy:

* make sure the correct ATtiny board and processor are selected
* choose the "8MHz (internal)" clock is selected
* then `Burn Bootloader`

This will not only set the fusues, but erase any program already on the chip and lay down a fresh bootloader

The Arduino IDE log window confirms what is going on.. note the `-Ulfuse:w:0xe2:m` fuse setting.

```

From the command line, I can interrogate the chip and verify the fuse settings:

```
$ avrdude -c stk500v1 -p attiny85 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem14521 -b 19200 -U lfuse:r:-:i

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:FF, H:DF, L:E2)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

The [engbedded fusecalc](http://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc) confirms the chip is now configured for 8MHz:
E:FF, H:DF, L:E2 are essentially factory defaults but with one change: the CKDIV8 prescaler is off, so it is running at 8 MHz.


### Setting Fuses Directly with avrdude

Updating fuses is simple with avrdude command line. This will leave everything else on the chip as-is.
It uses the update option:

`-U memtype:op:filename[:format]`

Where

* `memtype` will be hfuse (high fuse byte), lfuse (low fuse byte), efuse (extended fuse byte).
* `op` is `w`(rite)
* `filename` is just the hex value itself
* `format` is `m`, which indicates immediate mode; actual byte values specified on the command line (in place of `filename`)

So setting the ATtiny back to factory defaults (E:FF, H:DF, L:62) can be done like this:

```
$ avrdude -c stk500v1 -p attiny85 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem14521 -b 19200 -U efuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xdf:m -U lfuse:w:0x62:m

```

Now to just change the CKDIV8 from its factory setting, I just need to update the low fuse:


```
$ avrdude -c stk500v1 -p attiny85 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem14521 -b 19200 -U lfuse:w:0xe2:m

```

### Verifying 8MHz operation

OK, the chip tells us we're now running at 8MHz, but how to verify it?

One way to see the difference is to change the clock on a program that uses a timer-based function like `delay`
(which is locked to the processor clock frequency).

The [At8MHz.ino](./At8MHz.ino) is a simple example. It toggles LEDs attached to GPIO pins 1 and 2 with a 4 second delay (`delay(4000);`).

Load the sketch with the ATtiny set for default 1MHz operation (8MHz internal clock with /8 prescaler).
The LEDs will toggle roughly once every 4 seconds.

Then reset the fuses for 8MHz internal clock with no prescaler (not reloading the program),
and LEDs will toggle every half a second, which demonstrates that the processor is now running 8 times faster.
