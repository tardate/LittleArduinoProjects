# #253 ATtiny Programming Shield

A custom ATtiny programming shield for use with Arduino ISP

![Build](./assets/ProgrammingShield_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

I covered programming an ATtiny with the Arduino ISP in the [ProgrammingWithArduinoISP](../ProgrammingWithArduinoISP) project.

Since I've been programming a few more ATtiny processors, and simplify the processing of
programming an ATtiny with ArduinoISP, I wired up a strip of protoboard
to serve as a custom programming shield. This is the layout I chose:

![ProgrammingShield_layout](./assets/ProgrammingShield_layout.jpg?raw=true)

It's designed to be snapped onto an Arduino UNO, lined up with GPIO digital pins 8-13.

It includes two LEDs on PB0 and PB1, which can be used for debugging/testing a program loaded on the ATtiny.
