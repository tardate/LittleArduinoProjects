# #076 Monostable Pulse Extender

Use an Arduino to test the behaviour of a 74LS122 monostable with external timing configuration and plot the results.

## Notes

The 74LS122 monostable multivibrator in this circuit has pulse width programmed by selection of external resistance and capacitance values
R2 and C2. Pulse width is given as:

    tW = K * R2 * C2
    => where K is nominally 0.45. If C2 is in μF and R2 is in kΩ then tW is in seconds

For 33μF and 100kΩ then pulse width is [1.485s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.45+*+100+*+10^3+*+33+*+10^-6).
This is intentionally large so that a visible pulse produced.

Once triggered, the basic pulse width may be extended by retriggering the gated low-level-active (A) or high-level-active (B) inputs,
or be reduced by use of the overriding clear.

In this circuit an Arduino sends high-level-active (B) input pulses to trigger the monostable.
LEDs are separately connected to output Q and Q complement, so they will toggle as the pulse goes high and low respectively.

The Arduino also reads output Q with an analog input pin and sends the data to [LEAP#090 PlotNValues (a simple Processing sketch)](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/plotnvalues/).
Here's a trace of the behaviour. The lower trace is the trigger state, and the upper trace is the gate output.
