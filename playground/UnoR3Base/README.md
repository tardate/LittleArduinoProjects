# #770 Uno R3 Base

Testing various printed bases and cases for the classic Arduino Uno.

## Notes

When using an Arduino Uno, they typically end up just sitting directly on my workbench.
Not ideal:

* they can easily damage the desk surface
* any metal offcuts threaten to short various links on the Uno board

Luckily, I've never had any serious issues,
but since I have ready access to 3D Printer [services at the library](../../Equipment/NLB/FlashforgeCreatorPro2/),
I've been looking for a good base/case design.

The following are the designs I have checked out so far.

### Base 1: Arduino Uno R3 Base by dteck

The [Arduino Uno R3 Base by dteck](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:81375). Printed with:

* [arduino-uno-r3-base.stl](./assets/arduino-uno-r3-base.stl)
* [arduino-uno-r3-base.gx](./assets/arduino-uno-r3-base.gx)

Good points:

* simple approach - protects that base while providing full access to all pins and connectors
* designed with lugs to connect to standard breadboards

Issues:

* locating lugs are slightly oversized for many boards
* there is not quite enough space in the case for Uno boards that have pins fitted on the underside

This Uno board has pins fitted to the underside. It *just* fits onto the locating lugs, though teh board is actually sitting on the pins

After clipping off the underside pins, and also some protruding lugs from the power barrel jack, the Uno now sites cleanly in the base:

Nicely connects to a breadboard:
