## Notes

This demonstrates a circuit for generating a pulse on a falling edge.
It uses a 555 monostable circuit to generate a clean output pulse of fixed duration.
The output pulse is active-low logic, but this can be inverted in a following stage if required.

The input edge detection is achieved with a PNP inverter being AC-coupled (via capacitor C1) to the 555 timer's threshold input.
The threshold is normally pulled low (R3), and a diode (D1) is included to absorb much of the falling edge pulse.

## Behaviour

The scope trace below shows the pulse generated on the rising edge of the input.
The output pulse is around 250ms, close to the calculated [242ms](https://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=monostable&r1=22&c=10).

* CH1 (yellow) - input signal
* CH2 (blue) - RC filtered pulse
* CH3 (red) - output
