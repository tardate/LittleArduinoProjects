## Notes

A simple polarity testing circuit uses a series of inverters.
The input signal is pumped into two parallel chains:

* a single inverter
* a series of two inverters

So, regardless of input polarity, one chain output will be high and the other low.

| input | Single-inverter Output | Dual-inverter Output |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|
| LOW   | HIGH                   | LOW                  |
| HIGH  | LOW                    | HIGH                 |

The signals are tied together with two reverse-polarity LEDs in series. So one will always be alight when the other is not.
The unlit LED is subject to a reverse voltage equivalent to the forward voltage of the other LED. Most LEDs will handle this without complaint.
