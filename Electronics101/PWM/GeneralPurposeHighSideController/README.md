Build and test a general-purpose high-side PWM controller

## Notes

This circuit cobines a variable-duty cycle PWM generator with a high-side p-channel MOSFET driver circuit,
making it suitable for controlling loads up to 15V/23A.

### PWM Generator

The PWM signal is generated with a modified 555 Timer astable oscillator.

Steering diodes are used to isolate the 100kΩ pot so that it primarily adjusts duty cycle with little change to the frequency.

A switch allows selection of 1nF & 10nF capacitors, selecting a base PWM frequency of:

* 10nF - 1.25kHz
* 1nF - 12.6kHz

### High-side Driver

The PWM output switches an n-channel MOSFET which in turn controls the high-side p-channel Power MOSFET.

The shunt resistor R4 limits the bypass current when the n-channel MOSFET is on.
At 1kΩ, it wastes up to 15mA (at 15V) but in return allows fast switching of the Power FET.
A higher value of R4 (10kΩ, 100kΩ) saves power, but switching time is affected.

A pair of capacitors (220µF, 100nF) provide some smoothing of the power supply to the Power FET and decouple the PWM and FET loads.

### Performance - 10kΩ Resistive Load at 1.25kHz PWM

At 50% duty cycle:

At minimum duty cycle (~1.25%):

![lo_f_low_duty](./assets/lo_f_low_duty.gif?raw=true)

At maximum duty cycle, the output approaches 99.9% fully on.

### Performance - 10kΩ Resistive Load at 12.6kHz PWM

At 50% duty cycle:

At minimum duty cycle (~1.25%):

![hi_f_low_duty](./assets/hi_f_low_duty.gif?raw=true)

At maximum duty cycle, the output approaches 100% fully on.
