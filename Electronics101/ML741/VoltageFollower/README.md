# #157 ML741/VoltageFollower

Test a voltage follower/buffer circuit with the ML741 discrete component opamp


## Notes

This is a demonstration of a voltage follower circuit using the [ML741](../) discrete component opamp.
The general operation of a voltage follower is for the output to follow the non-inverting input, with a gain of 1, i.e.

    Vout = Vin

### How it works

Fundamentally, an op-amp strives to keep its inverting an non-inverting inputs equal by modulating the output.

When the non-inverting input rises above the inverting input, the output will rise to offset the differential.
Since there is 100% feedback to the non-inverting input, the output will immediately change to match the inverting input.

Voltage followers, also known as unity gain buffers, are often used to isolate circuit sub-systems since they
offer - at least in the idealised op-amp model - infinite impedence at the input and zero impedance at the output.

## ML741 v "real" 741 Test

Here are some results comparing the behaviour of a standard UA741CN chip with the ML741 (protoboard version).

Setup:
* power is 5V single rail, i.e. V- = GND
* non-inverting input is fed a sine wave 1Vpp with 2.5V DC offset (with a 1kΩ resistor in series for redundant protection)
* the function generator sine wave input replaces the manual 10kΩ pot in the schematic above

Scope connections
* CH1: non-inverting input
* CH2: output/inverting input

I've purposely driven the input signal such that it clips the lower output rail of both the ML741 and UA741CN,
because things get interesting around the rails.

### At 20kHz

* both tracking the input voltage quite well
* clean clipping at the lower output rail
* ML741 again proves its ability to drive lower than the standard UA741CN

UA741CN:

### At 80kHz

* both struggling to drop the output voltage fast enough
* the poorer ML741 response time has effectively increased its lower output limit so it is now higher than the UA741CN
* ML741 is the first to get into trouble (from 40kHz at least)
