# #158 ML741/Inverter

Test an inverter circuit using the ML741 discrete component opamp


## Notes

This is a demonstration of an inverter/inverting buffer circuit using the [ML741](../) discrete component opamp.
The general operation of the circuit is for the output to follow the inverse of the inverting input.
This is a special case of the general inverting amplifier configuration with gain set to -1, i.e.

    Vout = -Vin
    Rf = Rin

### How it works

Fundamentally, an op-amp strives to keep its inverting an non-inverting inputs equal by modulating the output.

In the inverter/inverting amplifier configuration, the inverting input is at the midpoint of the Rin:Rf voltage divider.
Hence the op amp achieves inverting/non-inverting input equilibrium when Vout = -Vin.


## Construction

In this circuit, I am using a single rail supply (V- = GND) instead of the "conventional" dual rail supply (V+/V-).

For this reason, the non-inverting input is pegged to V+/2 with a voltage divider.
In a dual rail configuration, V+/2 is usually "ground".

## ML741 v "real" 741 Test

Here are some results comparing the behaviour of a standard UA741CN chip with the ML741 (protoboard version).

Setup:
* power is 5V single rail, i.e. V- = GND
* non-inverting input is fed a sine wave 1Vpp with 2.5V DC offset
* the function generator sine wave input replaces the manual 10kÎ© input pot in the schematic above (at node FG)

Scope connections
* CH1: non-inverting input
* CH2: output

I've purposely driven the input signal such that it clips the lower output rail of both the ML741 and UA741CN,
because things get interesting around the rails.

### At 1kHz

* ML741 is performing nicely
* UA741CN hitting the lower rail at ~1.9v

UA741CN:

### At 40kHz

* ML741 starting to distort at the lower end
* UA741CN still performing similar to 1kHz

### At 100kHz

Both ML741 and UA741CN exhibiting similar distortion patterns:
waveforms have lost definition, are phase-shifted and attenuated
