# #219 DS18S20 1-Wire Reading

Basic interrogation of a DS18S20 using 1-wire protocol

## Notes

The DS18S20 is an inexpensive 1-Wire digital thermometer
with a range of -55°C to +125°C, at ±0.5°C Accuracy from -10°C to +85°C.

It comes in TO-92 packaging and may be powered directly (using three pins),
or take parasitic power from the data line (using two pins).

### Basic Operation

The sequence of operations boils down to this:

* Send a search request on the wire to find a device
* Get the device address and ensure the family code is as expected
* Issue conversion command (0x44)
* Wait for conversion, then read the conversion scratchpad from the device
* Process the data received

### Family Codes

| Model   | Code |
|---------|------|
| DS18S20 | 0x10 |
| DS18B20 | 0x28 |
| DS1822  | 0x22 |


### Example Code

The [OneWireReading.ino](./OneWireReading.ino) sketch is a basic demonstration based on the
examples on the [OneWire Arduino playground page](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/OneWire).

I've refactored a little to make the code more readable.

It constantly polls the DS18S20 device and logs to the serial output. Here's an example:
