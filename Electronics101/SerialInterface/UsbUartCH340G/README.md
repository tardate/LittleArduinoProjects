# #406 Custom CH340G USB to UART interface

Build a USB to TTL serial interface on a breadboard using the CH340G interface chip, and use it to program Arduino sketches on an ATmega328P.

## Notes

The CH340G is a USB to UART Interface chip. It is often used as a cheap alternative to
more established brands and products such as the FTDI FT232RL.
The CH340G is commonly found in:

* Arduino Nano clones
* USB to Serial adapters

In this project, I'd like to see how easy it is to build a USB to Serial interface
on a breadboard. To test it out, I'll use it program Arduino sketches on an ATmega328P.

## CH340G Key Specs

CH340 is produced by [WCH 江苏沁恒股份有限公司 (Jiangsu Yuheng Co., Ltd.)](http://www.wch.cn/).
It is a series of USB adapters - with variants providing serial, parallel or IrDA interfaces.
The CH340G supports serial with common flow control signals.

Key features:

* USB 2.0
* Supports common flow control signals RTS, DTR, DCD, RI, DSR and CTS.
* Supports RS232, RS422 and RS485 with external level shifting components.
* Baud rate range from 50bps to 2Mbps.
* 5V and 3.3V operation.

### Drivers and Setup for MacOSX

* see the offical [MacOSX setup notes](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MacOSX)
* if the Arduino has an FTDI instead of CH340G, if necessary install the [FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.dmg](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm)
* see the [arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=261375.0) - general discussion and updates on the issue of USB drivers


### CH340G Drivers

If the CH340G serial chip is not recognised my MacOSX, a driver is required. See:

* [How to use cheap Chinese Arduinos that come with with CH340G / CH341G Serial/USB chip](http://kiguino.moos.io/2014/12/31/how-to-use-arduino-nano-mini-pro-with-CH340G-on-mac-osx-yosemite.html) - a great guide.
* Updated driver (Sierra-compatible) is available at
[github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver)
* There also seems to be a professional drive kit available (at cost) from https://www.mac-usb-serial.com/

I've "cached" copies of the drivers I've used in the past in the [drivers](https://github.com/tardate/LittleArduinoProjects/tree/master/Electronics101/SerialInterface/UsbUartCH340G/drivers) folder:

* CH341SER_MAC.ZIP
* CH34x_Install_V1.3.zip - latest version I've used


## Chips and DIPs

I have some CH340G chips in SOP-16 package (from a seller on aliexpress).
I've mounted one on a DIP adapter, and found a micro-USB breakout:

## Examining a Commercial CH340 USB-Serial Adapter

I have a CH340G USB adapter that I
[got along with an Arduino mini](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/A96-Free-Shipping-USB2-0-To-TTL-6Pin-CH340G-Converter-Pro-Mini-Atmega328-5V-16M-For/1887601992.html),
so I took a closer look to see if it usde the CH340G chip in any unexpected ways.

Tracing the circuit, it turns out to be very straight-forward. A few things to note:

* the 3.3V/5V selector actually just enables/disables a 662K 3.3V regulator to supply the outbound pwer rail. It does not switch the operating voltage of the CH340G itself (or the data levels)
* includes a power indicator LED, and a transmit indicator LED
* has 1kΩ resistors inline the RX/TX lines; not particularly sure why (not mentioned in the CH340G data sheet)
* lots of ceramic bypass capacitors. I'm not sure of the actual capacitance values.

## Building the CH340G Interface on a Breadboard

On one breadboard, I have a basic 5V CH340G setup:

* RX and TX LEDs; Power LED
* DTR, TXD and RXD connected on the serial side

On another breadboard, I have an ATmega328 (with Arduino bootloader) wired up for programming.
See [LEAP#405 ATmegaSerialProgrammer](../../../playground/ATmegaSerialProgrammer) for more on programming over serial.

Here's a quick demo (uploading a sketch).
I'm programming the ATmega328 with the [UsbUartCH340G.ino](./UsbUartCH340G.ino) sketch - a simple blink
variant that also sends bursts of serial output (to exercise the RX LED).

## A Protoboard CH340G Demonstration

A final prototype before doing anything more serious - I've switched to SMD components and built up for testing on some protoboard with DIP adapters.
A few changes to the design:

* added a 500mA resetable polyfuse on the USB supply
* connected both DTR and CTS lines to the 6-pin device adapter
* bumped up the LED current-limiting resistors to 2.7kΩ

The device pinput sequence I've selected is as follows. This suits some devices, but may need wires crossed for others.

| Pin | Name | Note                          |
|-----|------|-------------------------------|
| 1   | DTR  |                               |
| 2   | RXD  | Connects to TX on the device  |
| 3   | TXD  | Connects to RX on the device  |
| 4   | VCC  |                               |
| 5   | CTS  |                               |
| 6   | GND  |                               |
