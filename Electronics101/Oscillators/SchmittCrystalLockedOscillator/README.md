# #612 Crystal-Locked Schmitt Oscillator

Testing a basic crystal-locked Schmitt oscillator using a 74HC14.

## Notes

I tested the basic Schmitt Oscillator a very long time ago in [LEAP#022](../SchmittOscillator).
I was prompted to try the crystal-locked variation after seeing CD40106 aka 74C14 covered in IMSAI Guy's chip of the day:

Oscillators of this topology are variously known as
[Pierce Oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_oscillator),
[Pierce-Gate Crystal Oscillators ](https://www.mpdigest.com/2018/04/23/pierce-gate-crystal-oscillator-a-revisit/)
or [CMOS Crystal Oscillators](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/oscillator/crystal.html).

An alternative design using NOR Gates:

### Circuit Design

The slowest crystal I have to hand is 4MHz, so I needed to add 20pF stabilization capacitors to maintain oscilation.
The second inverter buffers the output and the 51kÎ© feedback resistor ensure's the oscillator is kicked into action.
