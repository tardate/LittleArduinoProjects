## Notes

This circuit demonstrates a free-running oscillator based on two NOR gates - using 2/4 of a 74LS02.
I got the idea from [Beginning Digital Electronics Through Projects](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0750672692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0750672692&linkCode=as2&tag=itsaprli-20&linkId=S6GVIV6DHZABMHTA) which features a NOR gate metronome. The circuit needed a few tweaks to get running with a different NOR IC and supply voltage.

It's quite an interesting circuit, as you wouldn't necessarily think that two NOR gates could form a reliable oscillator.

The basic operating principle (as far as I understand it so far):
* when NOR(1) output is high, NOR(2) input is high and output low, and vice versa
* the switching of the NOR(1) gate input is delayed by the RC network:
* when NOR(2) output is low, C1 charges through the R4/R5 series from the NOR(1) high output
* this raises the voltage on NOR(1) input to such point that the NOR(1) output switches low
* then with NOR(2) output high, C1 discharges through R3 to the NOR(1) input to such point that the NOR(1) output switches high
* rinse and repeat

The Arduino is not really a core part of the circuit. It only does the following:
* provides +5V power supply (for convenience)
* measures the input and output voltages for plotting

Here's a sample trace recorded using the [PlotNValues](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/plotnvalues/) sketch.
It has four traces, from top to bottom:
* output of the first OR gate (which I belatedly realised was exactly the same node as the first trace, hence excluded from the schematics)
* inputs to the first OR gate
* output of the second OR gate (tapped as the main output)
* inputs to the second OR gate
