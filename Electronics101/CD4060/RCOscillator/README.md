# #293 CD4060 RC Oscillator

Exploring the behaviour of the CD4060 ripple counter driven by an RC oscillator.

## Notes

The CD4060 datasheet describes an RC oscillator configuration for self-driving the ripple counter.
A 50% duty cycle is achieved when R1 = R2.

In this test I'm using R1 = R2 = 10kΩ, and C1 = 1nF.
During charge/discharge, the equivalent resistance is 10kΩ|10kΩ i.e. 5kΩ,
so the time constant for the rising and falling phases is [5µs (200kHz)](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1nF+*5k%CE%A9).

Thus for a near complete charge/discharge of 5 time constants, we'd expect an oscillation of around
[40kHz](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(5*(1nF+*5k%CE%A9))).
In practice, I'm measuring 38.7kHz .. so the approximation appears to be pretty close.

Here's a trace of the oscillator (tapped at the net marked CH2 in the schematic):

The reset pin 12 should be pulled low to ensure stable operation.
If left floating it can cause spurious results such as picking up 50/60Hz oscillation.

### Ripple Counter

The CD4060 is a 14 stage ripple counter constructed of RS flip-flop units - see the functional diagram from the datasheet:

![CD4060_functional](../assets/CD4060_functional.png?raw=true)

The input signal passes 4 stages before the first output is tapped (Q4).
Thus the first (Q4) output signal divides the input frequency by a factor of 2^4

Stage 11 (Q11) of the ripple counter is also not exposed on a pin.

The lack of Q0-3 and Q11 is I think just pin economics so it all fits it in a DIP16 package.

The performance is summarised in the table and scope capture below.
