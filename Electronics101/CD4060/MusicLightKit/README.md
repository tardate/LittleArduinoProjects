# #291 CD4060/MusicLightKit

Learning how to use the CD4060 14-Stage Ripple Carry Binary Counter by building a music/LED-effects kit.

Here's a quick demo of the LED sequence in action..

## Notes

This is a pretty common kit widely available from sellers on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/CD4060-Dream-Music-Light-DIY-Kit-Birthday-Gift-Suite-Electronic-Production-of-DIY-Parts/32748833397.html), ebay and other outlets.
It comes in a few variations, but essentially all the same circuit.

It is an interesting demonstration of the CD4060 14-Stage Ripple Carry Binary Counter.

The kit includes a potted sound chip that plays "Happy Birthday". The music circuit runs completely independently of the CD4060-driven LED circuit.


### Julian Ilett's Build

This is the same kit covered by Julian Ilett:

### CD4060 Ripple Counter

The CD4060 is a 14 stage ripple counter constructed of RS flip-flop units - see the functional diagram from the datasheet:

![CD4060_functional](../assets/CD4060_functional.png?raw=true)

The CD4060 in this circuit is configured as a free-running counter, driven by an RC oscillator.
I investigated this technique in more detail in [LEAP#293 CD4060/RCOscillator](../RCOscillator).

As the oscillator triggers the CD4060, the outputs cycle/ripple. The circuit only uses three significant outputs: Q5, Q6, Q7.
These are steered with diodes to drive the three LED combinations. Q7 also triggers reset on the CD4060 to restart the sequence.

### Music Effects Chip

The music chip included in my kit is marked "H823" and plays "Happy Birthday". This appears to be a different chip
from the one included in [Julian Ilett's build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJFLz_hQsjo),
and doesn't suffer from the same problem of needing an extra base resistor for the transistor output.

However the piezzo speaker included in the kit sounds terrible; it works much better with a speaker.
But since there is no room on the board for a speaker, I decided not to build the music circuit in this kit.

Instead I've tested the H823 chip in a separate project -
[LEAP#292: AudioEffectsChips/H823](../../../Audio/AudioEffectsChips/H823).
