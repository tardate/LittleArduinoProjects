## Notes

The DS1822 is an economy 1-Wire digital thermometer
with a range of -55°C to +125°C, at ±2.0°C Accuracy from -10°C to +85°C.

It comes in TO-92 packaging and may be powered directly (using three pins),
or take parasitic power from the data line (using two pins).

### Basic Operation

The sequence of operations boils down to this:

* Send a search request on the wire to find a device
* Get the device address and ensure the family code is as expected
* Issue conversion command (0x44)
* Wait for conversion, then read the conversion scratchpad from the device
* Process the data received

### Family Codes

| Model   | Code |
|---------|------|
| DS18S20 | 0x10 |
| DS18B20 | 0x28 |
| DS1822  | 0x22 |

## The Program

The Arduino sketch is found in [DS1822.ino](./DS1822.ino).
It uses:

* [OneWire](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/OneWire) library for temperature sensor communication
* [u8glib](https://github.com/olikraus/U8glib_Arduino) library for driving a simple display on a Nokia 5110 screen.

The sketch was written to work with the DS1822, but it can also handle DS18S20 and DS18B20 devices.
