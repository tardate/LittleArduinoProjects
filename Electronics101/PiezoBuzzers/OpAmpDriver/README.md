# #583 OpAmp Piezo Driver

Testing a circuit for driving a piezoelectric transducer for sound output with a TL072 opamp oscillator.

## Notes

As discussed in [LEAP#455 Piezo Transducers and Buzzers](./..), piezoelectric transducer
require an external oscillator to produce sound.

This is an example of an OpAmp driver:

* comparator-based relaxation oscillator implemented with one OpAmp from a TL072
* 2N7000 switch to enable the oscillator
* driving a [passive buzzer element](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32913849609.html)

NB: I have seen silimar circuits with an NPN BJT switch but some of these don't seem to turn the oscillator hard enough off.

## Results

Works fine - emits a constant tone when the button is pressed.

A crude estimate just considering the 20kÎ© and 10nF RC path suggest a frequncy [~796 Hz](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F%282%CF%80+*+20k%CE%A9+*+10nF%29). Actually 844Hz acording to the scope..
