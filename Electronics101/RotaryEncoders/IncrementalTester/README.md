## Notes

Incremental [Rotary encoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder) typically provide quadrature output on two pins:

[LEAP#118 RotaryEncoderMethods](../../../playground/RotaryEncoderMethods) demonstrates various ways of using a rotary encoder with an Arduino,
but I'm inspired to throw away the microcontroller for a more basic demonstration
after reading [Experiment 101: Rotary Encoders](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/protected/Group/Members/ProductReview/Hands%20On%20Radio%20June%202011.pdf)
from [ARRL Hands-on Radio (Vol 2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198290-arrl-s-hands-on-radio-experiments-volume-2).

This project demonstrates a forward/reverse LED indicator using simple digital logic
and a [mini rotary encoder (from seller on aliexpress)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10-pcs-Handle-Length-15MM-EC12-E12-Audio-Encoder-360-Degree-Rotary-Encoder-Tripod/32308666522.html).

## Design

Key thing to note from the quadrature diagram:

> on the edge of one output from the rotary encoder, the level of the other output will indicate whether rotation is forward or reverse

This insight is used by [Experiment 101: Rotary Encoders](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/protected/Group/Members/ProductReview/Hands%20On%20Radio%20June%202011.pdf),
where one signal is considered a clock source and the other the data to be latched with a CD4013 D-type flip-flop.
The output controls a "forward" LED, and the complementary output drives the "reverse" LED.

I don't have any CD4013 on hand, so modified the idea to work with 74LS173.
The 74LS173 is a 4 bit D latch and doesn't have complementary outputs, so in this design it uses two of the
D latches - one configured to drive the "forward" indicator, the other for the "reverse".
The 74LS173 can source/sink enough current to drive and LED at under 5mA in either direction.

The 74LS173 clocks on the rising edge

| CL | -G0 | -G1 | CLK (A) | D (B) | Q   | Inferred Rotation |
|----|-----|-----|---------|-------|-----|-------------------|
| 0  | 0   | 0   | rising  | 0     | 0   | CW                |
| 0  | 0   | 0   | rising  | 1     | 1   | CCW               |

There are may other ways of achieving this. For example one other alternative I scoped out was using a 74LS73 JK Flip-flop and an inverter.

## Construction

I tested this out on a breadboard first. The 100nF capacitors coupled with the 10kÎ© pullup resistors on the A/B rotary encoder
connections are for hardware de-bouncing.

But then decided to capture the circuit on protoboard using this layout:

The final protoboard build:

## Testing

I added pin headers to the protoboard to assist capturing signals with a scope.
Here are some traces where:

* CH1 (yellow) - CLK (A)
* CH2 (blue) - D(B)

Here's a clockwise (CW) rotation capture. Note the effectiveness of the hardware de-bouncing - quite clean transitions.

Here's a counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation capture:
