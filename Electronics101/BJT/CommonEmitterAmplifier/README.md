## Notes

Time to revisit the basics of biasing a bipolar junction transistor in an NPN common-emitter amplifier configuration.
I am inspired once again by one of w2aew's excellent vidoes - this time
[#113: Basics of Transistor bias point and the class of amplifier operation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6cmkm3UPUI).

### The Common Emitter Amplifier

The common emitter (CE) amplifier arrangement refers to cases where the transistor emitter shares a connection to both the input and output signal
(ignoring resistors that may be in the path).

CE amplifiers generally have:

* "modest" gain
* input impedence of a few kΩ
* inverted output

Biasing the amplifier aims to place the transistor somewhere in the active region, between cut-off and saturation.
Specifically, this means setting the:

* DC operating point (Quiescent Point) with no applied input signal
* gain

Together these will determine the class of operation.

### Class of Operation

| Class | Amplifies                                  | Typical Applications                  |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A     | entire waveform without distortion (360˚)  | high fidelity linear audio amplifiers |
| B     | half cycle (180˚)                          | RF                                    |
| C     | less than half cycle (< 180˚)              | oscillator circuits                   |
| AB    | between half and full cycle (180˚-360˚)    | audio power amplifiers                |

It may seem like class A should always be preferred, but that is not true as it is also the most power hungry.

### Design Steps

An approach and example for selecting values for a simple CE amplifier:


#### 1. Choose the operating requirements:

* VCC = 5V
* A = 2 (low gain)
* quiescent current Icq = 4mA (a value to keep power dissipation low)
* quescent voltage Vceq = 2.5 V (rule of thumb - about half VCC)
* assume ß (hFE) = 150 (or lookup the datasheet)
* assume Vbe = 0.7V (or lookup the datasheet)


#### 2. calculate collector + emitter resistance for desired gain at the Q point

Aiming for Vcc/2

* Rc + Re = (5V/2) / 4mA = [625Ω](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(5V+-+2.5V)+%2F+4mA)


#### 3. calculate Rc and Re for desired gain

* A ≅ Rc/Re
* Re = 625Ω - Rc
* Rc = 2 * 625Ω - 2 * Rc
* Rc = 2/3 * 625Ω
* Re = 1/3 x 625Ω = 208Ω, say 220Ω (standard value)
* Rc = 416Ω, say 470Ω (standard value)


#### 4. calculate base current at the q point

* Ib = 4mA / 150 = [0.02667mA](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4mA%2F150)


#### 5. calculate the combined bias gang resistance

assume current through the gang at 10 x Ib as a rule of thumb to ensure "stiff" biasing i.e. 0.2667mA

so combined resistance = `5V/0.2667mA` = [18.8kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5V%2F0.2667mA)


#### 6. calculate the resistance of R1 and R2 components of the bias gang

Lower resistor R2:

voltage = 0.7 + Ic x Re = [1.58V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.7V+%2B+4mA*220%CE%A9)

therefore R2 = [5924Ω](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.58V%2F0.2667+mA)
so choose 5 kΩ (standard value)

and therefore R1 = [13.8kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=18.8k%CE%A9+-+5k%CE%A9)
so choose 12kΩ (standard value)


#### 7. review input limits

with a design gain of 2, and assuming we have say 4V peak-to-peak headroom around the 2.5V quiesent point,
we should be able to handle signals of [2V peak-to-peak](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=4V%2F2)

That's all pretty theoretical and assumes nothing much about the transistor performance (except for ß), so let's see how it works in practice.

With a 10kz 0.8V peak-to-peak input, here's how I see the output on a scope.

* CH1: input (AC coupled)
* CH2: output (AC coupled)


![scope_class_a](./assets/scope_class_a.gif?raw=true)

That's pretty spot-on!

* input bias point is around 1.48V, actually measures 816mV peak-to-peak on the scope
* output is centered on 3.12 V, and measures 1.68V peak-to-peak
* so an actual gain of [2.06](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.68%2F0.816)
* no distortion - nice clean class A amplification


### Bias Class Testing

Borrowing heavily from w2aew's tutorial, I've wired up a circuit to demonstrate the different classes of operation
by switching R1.


#### Class B Operation

For class B (half waveform), we want the bias point to sit at around 0.6 to 0.7 V (the Vbe voltage drop).

Keeping R2 at 5kΩ, we should switch R1 to around [37kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(5+-+0.6)%2F0.6+%3D+x%2F5) to scale the bias point.

Here's the result. Just about perfect.

* CH1: input (DC coupled)
* CH2: output (DC coupled and offset -5V)

![scope_class_b](./assets/scope_class_b.gif?raw=true)

Note: I didn't scale R1 and R2 back accordingly to keep the current through the bias gang above 10 x Ib.

#### Class C Operation

For class C (less that half waveform), I just increased and adjusted R1 by trial and error to get a minimal peak.
Finally settled at R1 ~80kΩ.

* CH1: input (DC coupled)
* CH2: output (DC coupled and offset -5V)

![scope_class_c](./assets/scope_class_c.gif?raw=true)

Note: I didn't scale R1 and R2 back accordingly to keep the current through the bias gang above 10 x Ib.

### Input and Output Impedence Calculation

Input impedance:

* the input sees R1, R2 and the impedence of the base (about 33k, hFE * Re) in parallel, so around 5kΩ
* the input capacitor combines with the resistance in a high-pass filter, C1 should be chosen to ensure input frequencies are far above the 3dB point

Output impedence:

* just Rc in parallel with the impedence looking into the collector, which is "very large"
* so Rc is a good approximation i.e. 470Ω in this case


## Bypassed Emitter Resistor and Other Refinements

It is common to see a bypass capacitor in parallel with the emittor resistor.
This improves stability of a grounded emitter amplifier i.e. when Re is low to maximise gain.
No calculations or experiments for that here yet.

In practice, biasing can get a whole lot more complex, and "real" amplifier circuits may involve multiple transistors, either in Darlington
or push-pull configurations, with biasing tricks that involve diodes to fix particular voltage drops.


## Breadboard Construction

I first breadboarded this experiment, and used an external function generator for the 10kHz input signal.

## Ugly Demo Board

Just for fun, I mounted the circuit ugly style on some discarded packaging.
A jumper is used to select from the pre-set Class A, B, C configurations.

Under test, performs just fine..
