Designing a two-stage common-emitter BJT amplifier.

## Notes

Cascading two common-emitter amplifiers is a means of achieving high voltage gain.
Voltage gains from several hundred to several thousand are possible.

I'm going to try and noodle out a theoretical design of a two-stage Class A amplifier, and then test the actual performance.
Do *not* take my calculations as gospel. My main sources for the theory were
[Electronic Principles by Albert Paul Malvino](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/942642.Electronic_Principles)
and a [Multistage Transistor Amplifiers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbdZ46VdTjE) YouTube tutorial by The Offset Volt:

### Designing a Single Stage for Gain ~ 10

| Parameter | Design/Spec Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| A (gain)  | 10                |
| Vcc       | 9V                |
| Icq       | 4mA               |
| Vceq      | 4.5V              |
| ß (hFE)   | 100 - 400         |
| hie       | 1kΩ - 10kΩ        |
| Vbe       | 0.7V              |
| RL        | 2.2kΩ             |

Also:

* r'e = hie/hFE = 10kΩ/400 = 25Ω

#### Calculate collector + emmiter resistance for desired gain at the Q point

* Rc + Re = (Vcc - Vceq) / Icq
* Rc + Re = (9V - 4.5V)/4mA = [1.13kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(9V+-+4.5V)%2F4mA)
* assuming A ≅ Rc/Re
* Re = 1.13kΩ - Rc
* Re = 1.13kΩ/11 =100Ω
* Rc = 1.03kΩ, say 1kΩ

With the selected components, the theoretical gain is thus [10](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1k%CE%A9%2F100%CE%A9)

#### Calculate the combined bias gang resistance

Base current at the q point

* Ib = 4mA / 100 = 0.04mA

Assume current through the gang at 10 x Ib as a rule of thumb to ensure "stiff" biasing i.e. 0.4 mA

So combined resistance = [22.5kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9V%2F0.4mA)

#### Calculate the resistance of R1 and R2 components of the bias gang

Lower resistor R2:

voltage = 0.7 + Ic x Re = [1.1V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.7V+%2B+4mA*100%CE%A9)

therefore R2 = [2.75kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.1V%2F0.4mA)
say 3kΩ (standard value)

and therefore R1 = [19.5kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=22.5k%CE%A9+-+3k%CE%A9)
say 20kΩ (standard value)

#### Measure Performance - Single Stage

![single-stage-bb-test](./assets/single-stage-bb-test.jpg?raw=true)

With 0.2V peak-peak 10kHz input, and Re = 100Ω (without emitter bypass), measured results:

* 0.2V input peak-peak
* 1.98V output peak-peak
* actual gain = [9.9](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.98V%2F0.2V)

Conclusion: very close to design gain of 10, undistorted Class A performance.

### Adjusting Single Stage Design with Bypass

I decided to add another 100Ω/100µF emitter bypass to the design, for a few reasons:

* it's a common feature of such designs
* it provides negative feedback to stabilise for transistor variations (AC signals will vary the emitter resistance with inverse relationship to input/output differential, thus combating variation)
* reduces the gain a bit (so I can work with larger input signals in two-stage configuration while staying within the 9V supply limits)

Recalculating with this variation. DC characteristics are now:

* Re = 200Ω
* A ≅ Rc/Re = 1kΩ/200Ω = 5

combined base bias resistance should still be = [22.5kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9V%2F0.4mA)

Lower resistor R2 is now:

voltage = 0.7 + Ic x Re = [1.5V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.7V+%2B+4mA*200%CE%A9)

therefore R2 = [3.75kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5V%2F0.4mA)
say 3.6kΩ (standard value)

and therefore R1 = [18.9kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=22.5k%CE%A9-3.6k%CE%A9)
say 20kΩ (standard value)

### Calculating Two-stage Performance with RL load

With:

* component values duplicated the from the single-stage design for two stages
* with the extra `100Ω||100µF` emitter bypass
* and RL = 2.2kΩ

predicted performance calculated as follows:

DC analysis:

* Vb = Vcc*Rb2/(Rb1 + Rb2) = 9V * 3.6kΩ/(20kΩ + 3.6kΩ) = [1.37V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9V+*+3.6k%CE%A9%2F(20k%CE%A9%2B3.6k%CE%A9))
* Ve = Vb - 0.7V = 0.67V
* Ie = Ve/Re = 0.67V/(200Ω) = [3.35mA](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.67V%2F200%CE%A9)
* Ie ≅ Ic
* Vrc = Ic * Rc = 3.35mA * 1kΩ = 3.35V
* Vce = Vcc - (Vrc + Ve) = 9V - (3.35V + 0.67V) = [4.98V](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9V-(3.35V%2B0.67V))
* Isat = Vcc/(Re + Rc) = 9V/(200Ω + 1kΩ) = [7.5mA](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9V%2F(200%CE%A9%2B1k%CE%A9))

Second stage:

* assuming thermal voltage VT = kT/q = 25 mV
* r'ej = VT/Ie = [7.5Ω](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=25mV%2F3.35mA)
* A2 = `Rc||RL/(Re2 + r'ej)` = `1k||2.2kΩ/(100Ω + 7.5Ω)` = [6.4](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(1%2F1k%CE%A9+%2B+1%2F2.2k%CE%A9)%2F(100%CE%A9%2B7.5%CE%A9))
* Rin(base) = ß(Re2 + r'ej) = 100(100Ω + 7.5Ω) = 10.75kΩ
* Zin = `Rin(base)||Rb1||Rb2` = `10.75kΩ||20kΩ||3.6kΩ` = [2.38kΩ](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(1%2F10.75k%CE%A9%2B1%2F20k%CE%A9%2B1%2F3.6k%CE%A9))
* A1 = `Rc1||Zin/(Re1 + r'ej)` = `1kΩ||2.38kΩ/(100Ω + 7.5Ω)` = [6.55](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(1%2F1k%CE%A9%2B1%2F2.38k%CE%A9)%2F(100%CE%A9+%2B+7.5%CE%A9))
* Total gain A = A1 * A2 = 6.4 * 6.55 = [41.92](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6.4*6.55)

Assuming headroom for say 7V peak-peak, input limit would be around [0.17V peak-peak](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=7V%2F41.92)
before clipping.

#### Measure Performance - Two Stage

With 0.1V peak-peak 10kHz input, and Re = 200Ω (with 100Ω/100µF bypass), measured results:

* 0.1V input peak-peak
* 3.88V output peak-peak
* actual gain = 38.8 = [31.8 dB](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=20log10(38.8))
* error in the theoretical gain calc = [7%](hhttps://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(41.92-38.8)%2F41.92)

Conclusion: predicted performance was quite close to the actual performance.
And .. I have a functioning two-stage Class A amplifier to boot, with performance "in the ballpark" of the design.

### Performance With an Ugly-style Build

![TwoStageCommonEmitterAmplifier_ugly](./assets/TwoStageCommonEmitterAmplifier_ugly.jpg?raw=true)

With an ugly-style build, I see even better performance, and improved gain:

* 0.1V input peak-peak
* 4.32V output peak-peak
* actual gain = 43.2 = [32.71 dB](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=20log10(43.2))
* error in the theoretical gain calc = [-3%](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(41.92-43.2)%2F41.92)

More gain when built "properly", this time overshooting estimates by a small margin (less than the tolerance on components).

At 400kHz, perfromance is maintained:
