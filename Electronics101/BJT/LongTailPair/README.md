# #094 BJT Long-tail Pair

Test a BJT "long-tail" differential amplifier circuit.

Here's a quick demo of the circuit in action:

## Notes

Differential amplifiers are excellently described in [w2aew's tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/mejPNuPAHBY).

This is a build and test of the basic long-tail circuit with no frills, which means the circuit is not ideal because:
* it relies on matched transistors
* output voltage varies with input voltage levels
* differential gain varies with input voltage levels
* only has moderate differential gain

The circuit includes an LED pair and resistor load between the outputs. This provides red/green - left/right balance indicator.

What is immediately noted is that gain varies wildly given different input voltages,
from approaching 0 at large voltage differences (clipped by the circuit I believe),
to 10-100 for small variations.

There are two improvements suggested by w2aew that will bring this circuit closer to an OpAmp:
* constant current circuit on the emitter, to eliminate the impact of input voltage on output voltage and gain.
* current mirror on the collectors, to improve gain

I'll try these improvements in another project file.

### Monitoring with an Arduino

The Arduino program is used to monitor the input and output voltages, calculate the differentials and gain.
Readings are made using 1MÎ© voltage dividers, to limit impact on the circuit and to scale the voltages to
the 5V range supported by the Arduino analog input pins.

Although not particularly accurate, it gives a rough indication of behaviour. For example:

```
Sample:
                ao1: 2919 mV
                ao2: 2371 mV
                ab1: 1837 mV
                ab2: 1793 mV
 input_differential: -88 mV
output_differential: -1096 mV
               gain: 12.45
```
