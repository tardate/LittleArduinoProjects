Examining the design and performance of an ac-coupled negative feedback amplifier constructed with BJTs.

## Notes

Negative feedback is by definition the concept of using a fraction of the output to dampen the input.
When designed appropriately, this can trade some gain for higher linearity and stability,
and reduced sensitivity to component parameter variations.

## Circuit

The circuit design used here is based on a fairly common "Negative Feedback Amplifier Kit" (easily found on Aliexpress or eBay).
It essentially a two-stage common-emitter amplifier with a feedback loop from the output of the final stage to the emitter of the first stage.
NB: the circuit is exactly as covered in 10-5 Two-Stage Feedback of
[Electronic Principles by Albert Paul Malvino](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/942642.Electronic_Principles).

The feedback loop creates an AC voltage divider between the output and ground:

    ve = RF1/(RF1 + RF2) . vo

Thus the negative feedback: the first stage output is reduced in proportion to an increase in the second stage output

See [LEAP#389 TwoStageCommonEmitterAmplifier](../TwoStageCommonEmitterAmplifier), for a similar two-stage CE amplifier but without feedback.
