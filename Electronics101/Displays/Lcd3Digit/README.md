## Notes

I found this small
[10PIN TN Positive 3-Digits Segment LCD Panel 3.0V Digital Tube Display](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003745628043.html)
from a seller on aliexpress.

The part is multiplexed liquid crystal display that must be driven at 1/4 duty, 1/2 bias.

### Part Specifications

The main technical parameters of the product:

* Dimensions: 11.5*10.3mm
* Conductive glass thickness: 0.7mm
* Minimum pixel gap: 10µm
* Duty ratio: 1/4 duty 1/2 bias
* Voltage: 3.0V
* Working temperature: -0˚C to +50˚C
* Viewing direction: 6 points
* Twisted Nematic (TN) type viewing range 60 degrees. Reflection
* Connection: 10 pin, dual inline with 2mm pin pitch

Since the module has a 2mm pin pitch, I squeezed it onto a DIP10 adapter board for use on a breadboard..

### Pin Functions

| Pin       | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 10 - COM1 |    | 3D |    | 2D |    | 1D |
|  9 - COM2 | 3C | 3E | 2C | 2E | 1C | 1E |
|  8 - COM3 | 3B | 3G | 2B | 2G | 1B | 1G |
|  7 - COM4 | 3A | 3F | 2A | 2F | 1A | 1F |

### Multiplexed LCD Control

LCD panels like this one must be driven directly. Each LCD segment must be driven with an AC signal,
as the are capacitive in nature.

* 1/2 bias: means the COMmon signals are driven at 3 levels: +VCC, VCC/2, and 0
* 1/4 duty: meaning we have 4 COMmon signals, each take 1/4 of the duty cycle

The basic mechanism:

* COM1-4 are normally at VCC/2
* COM1-4 each in turn will clock to VCC, then 0 and back to VCC/2
* SEGMENT pins will all clock in phase to be "off", constantly feeding the segments an AC signal between +VCC/2 and -VCC/2
* to turn segment "on", it is inversely clocked during the corresponding common clocking cycle. this will pulse the segment with an AC signal between +VCC and -VCC

### Multiplexed Digit Encoding

Digit segments are "lettered" in the conventional order:

    |-a-|
    f   b
    |-g-|
    e   c
    |-d-|

Each digit is encoded with two segment lines ("d0, d1") over the 4 COM states.
So the encoding table is as follows:

    | com:  |  COM 4  |  COM 3  |  COM 2  |  COM 1  |
    |-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    | line: | d1 | d0 | d1 | d0 | d1 | d0 | d1 | d0 |
    |-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    | seg:  | f  | a  | g  | b  | e  | c  | d  | -  |
    |-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
    |    0: | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
    |    1: | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
    |    2: | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
    |    3: | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
    |    4: | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
    |    5: | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
    |    6: | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
    |    7: | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
    |    8: | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
    |    9: | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
    |-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|

### AVR Arduino/ATmega328 Raw Driver Design

For testing purposes, I'll be using an ATmega328P with a program that directly implements the necessary LCD control.
I'll run the chip at 3V to avoid level-shifting.

To simplify programming and allow for bulk GPIO operations, I've aligned the pin connections with two GPIO ports -
COM pins on port PB, and SEG pins on PC:

| Port | Arduino Pin | ATmega328 Pin | LCD pin |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| PB0  | 8           | 14            | COM1    |
| PB1  | 9           | 15            | COM2    |
| PB2  | 10          | 16            | COM3    |
| PB3  | 11          | 17            | COM4    |
| PC0  | 14/A0       | 23            | SEG1    |
| PC1  | 15/A1       | 24            | SEG2    |
| PC2  | 16/A2       | 25            | SEG3    |
| PC3  | 17/A3       | 26            | SEG4    |
| PC4  | 18/A4       | 27            | SEG5    |
| PC5  | 19/A5       | 28            | SEG6    |

For demonstration purposes, I'll just have the code run a simple seconds timer.

### Algorithm Outline

There are basically two timing loops:

* per second, increment the number to display
* cycle the COM line at > 30 Hz to prevent flicker

The COM refresh loop is an 8-stage cycle, where COM pins toggle between (H)igh, (L)ow or High-(Z):

| step | COM1 | COM2 | COM3 | COM4 |
|------|------|------|------|------|
|    0 |  H   |  Z   |  Z   |  Z   |
|    1 |  L   |  Z   |  Z   |  Z   |
|    2 |  Z   |  H   |  Z   |  Z   |
|    3 |  Z   |  L   |  Z   |  Z   |
|    4 |  Z   |  Z   |  H   |  Z   |
|    5 |  Z   |  Z   |  L   |  Z   |
|    6 |  Z   |  Z   |  Z   |  H   |
|    7 |  Z   |  Z   |  Z   |  L   |

When setting the number to display:

* update the 8 SEG encoding patterns for the 8 COM steps

For each COM step:

* increment/reset the step counter
* set COM port state (output / high Z)
* write COM port output value

### Simple (Unoptimised) Approach

All the GPIO operations can be performed with standard
[pinMode](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/pinmode/)
[digitalWrite](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/digital-io/digitalwrite/)

The [Simple.ino](./Simple/Simple.ino) sketch implements this simple approach.
It runs at around 40Hz full duty cycle. Here is a scope trace of an example COM/SEG pair:

* COM1 - CH1 Yellow
* SEG6 - CH2 Blue

### Clever (Optimised) Approach

The LCD refresh is fully determined by the
[register configuration](https://exploreembedded.com/wiki/AVR_I/O_Register_Configuration)
of the DDRx and PORTx registers.

So instead of using the standard AVR functions, it is much easier and efficient (though perhaps a little more opaque)
to simply update the 4 registers of concern: DDRB, DDRC, PORTB, PORTC.

I haven't implemented this version (yet).
