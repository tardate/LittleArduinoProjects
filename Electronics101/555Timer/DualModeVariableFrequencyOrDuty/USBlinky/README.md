Here's a quick demo..

## Notes

This is a quick demonstrator for the [LEAP#563 Dual Variable Mode Oscillator](../) just for fun.

I'm using the shell of an old [USB Webmail Notifier](http://www.usbgeek.com/products/usb-webmail-notifier) device for mounting the circuit.

It is curiously hypnotic to play with:

* switch between variable frequency/fixed duty and variable duty/fixed frequency mode
* use the variable resistor to adjust the frequencvy or duty (depending on mode)

Four strawhat blue LEDs provide enough illumination for the shell, with fairly low current limiting resistors (100Î©).
The 2N7000 has just enough current handling capability (200mA continuous) for the 4 LEDs.

## Construction

the circuit extends the [Dual Variable Mode Oscillator](../) circuit with a N-channel FET low-side controlled array of 4 LEDs.

## Putting it in the shell

I opted for a freeform construction of the circuit rather than squeeze a PCB into the box.
Only the power lines of the USB connector are used.
