## Notes

This is a simple latching circuit for push-button on/off control using the 555 timer.

How it works:

* by default:
    * the push-button is not pressed
    * the R1/R2 voltage divider pulls the 555 threshold and trigger pins to the mid-level
    * thus neither THRESHOLD(reset) or TRIGGER(set) inputs to the 555 are enabled and
    * the 555 output state is unchanged
* when the push-button is pressed:
    * if the current output is LOW,
        * the R1/R2 voltage divider mid-point will be pulled LOW
        * TRIGGER(set) falls bellow the 1/3 set-point, causing the 555 to set and output to go HIGH
        * the capacitor C1 holds the button input LOW for long enough for the button to be released
    * if the current output is HIGH,
        * the R1/R2 voltage divider mid-point will be pulled HIGH
        * THRESHOLD(reset) rises above the 2/3 set-point, causing the 555 to reset and output to go LOW
        * the capacitor C1 holds the button input high for long enough for the button to be released

### Protoboard Build

Transfering the design to a small protoboard so that it can be used as a latched switch input.
