# #xxx 555 Compact LED Flasher

An unusual configuration of the 555 produces an astable oscillation with minimal, small components.

## Notes

Franz Bachler designed the
[LED Flasher](https://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/50%20-%20555%20Circuits/50%20-%20555%20Circuits.html#LED-Flasher)
circuit as seen on Talking Electronics.

The design has the distinct advantage of only requiring two resistors and a low value capacitor -
components that may be compressed into a very small package. Ideal for discrete blinking LED circuits.

### Circuit Design

The circuit can work from as low as a 3V supply, but 5-9V gives best results (without adjusting R2).
