## Notes

There are quite a few circuits (see links below) that use a humble 555 timer chip as a medium-wave transmitter.
Here's my variant. It doesn't get much simpler than this!

The 555 is used to generate a carrier wave, with the pot adjusting the frequency between the
extremes of
[64.8kHz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=0.22&r2=11&c=0.001) and
[648kHz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=0.22&r2=1&c=0.001).
Since R1 is comparatively small compared to R2, the duty cycle is kept close to 50%.

The timer output (pin 3) drives the base of an NPN transistor which switches a signal to nowhere .. or at least just down a length of wire acting as the antenna. I used a BC547, but any small-signal NPN would work.

The audio input modulates the output by wiggling the base voltage around a 10nF capacitor link to ground.

Since the circuit is essentially modulating a square wave, the carrier is not particularly selective and
the result is quite a broadband signal. There's no trouble picking up the signal on an AM radio above and
below the natural and harmonic frequencies. Well, we get a signal, but lots of noise also ... but it does work!
