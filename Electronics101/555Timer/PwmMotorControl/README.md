## Notes

Pulse-width Modulation (PWM) is a common method for controlling the speed of DC motors.

The PWM duty cycle controls the nett power being provided to the motor,
but by maintaining a constant "on" voltage, the torque is not greatly affected by speed.

The PWM frequency is not so important, however there will be a "sweet spot" for a particular motor:

* too high, and low speed control can be affected (not enough power delivered in each "on" cycle to move the motor)
* too low, and vibration and "chugging" can be a problem
* need to avoid resonant frequencies of the mechanical assembly

A 555 timer makes a simple controller. Here I've used a "diode-steered" variable duty cycle configuration,
with PWM duty cycle controlled with a 100kÎ© variable resistor.

The motor I'm testing with is a small DC motor, with a [fly-back diode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode) to dissipate
the voltage spike as the motor load is switched.
