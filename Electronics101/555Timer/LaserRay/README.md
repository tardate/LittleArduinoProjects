## Notes

This is an old circuit that supposedly produces a "laser ray" effect - sound beats and blinking LED.
It works; nothing to write home about though!

## Construction

An 8Î© speaker can be directly attached to C2, however for this build I've attached a piezo buzzer (J1) with biasing resistors (R3, R4).

The circuit needs at least 5V to operate. Higher voltages up to ~12V can be used, and the voltage changes the effect.
I've provided two power points:

* micro USB with switch - taps 5V from USB
* JST connector for direct power (bypasses the switch)
