Here's a quick video of it in action:

## Notes

Julian Ilett really does excellent videos on YouTube, even when he's just building a dinky electronic kit
like this [555 Roulette wheel](https://youtu.be/zgfJeZ20nhc).

So I got myself one of the kits too - mine was all of USD1.11 with free shipping from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1Pcs-Electronic-Lucky-Rotary-Suite-DIY-Kits-Production-Parts-And-Components-New/32319812188.html). Dang, now it is only USD1.05!!

And surprise, surprise - mine also came with surface mount components despite the product info online that clearly details DIPs and through-the-hole parts.
Never mind, a chance to steady my hand for a bit of surface-mount soldering.
The IC pin pitch is not too fine, but you definitely need tweezers to deal with the [MELFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MELF_electronic_components).

I must say I was also a little surprised when the unit worked first go - I was sure there would be at least one dry solder joint or bridged connection somewhere.

So how does it work? Basically like this I think:

* pressing the switch charges the R1/C1 network and turns on the Q1 NPN
* Q1 will remain on while C1 discharges through R1 with time constant (ùõï) of [22s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=470k%CE%A9+*+47%CE%BCF).
* Q1 activates the 555 in astable configuration, with a decaying frequency governed by the discharge of C2 through R3 when Q1 turns off.
* pulse stream from 555 pin 3 feeds the CD4017 pin 14 clock signal
* the CD4017 will enable its 10 output pins in sequence, lighting the attached LED, until the pulse stream stops

Note: this is the same basic "ROULETTE Circuit" as found in many 555 circuit references, such as
