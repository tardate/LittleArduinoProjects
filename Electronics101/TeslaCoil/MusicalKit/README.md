## Notes

The "Mini Music Tesla Coil Plasma Speaker" is a pretty popular kit,
widely available on ebay or for example [here on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000030185359.html).
I was encouraged to pop one in my cart (USD6.29 at the time) after seeing the build video by NFM:

### Kit and Parts

The kit may or not come with a schematic (mine didn't), but it is not needed for construction - only understanding!

Most sellers specify

* voltage: 15-24V DC
* current: 2A

## Circuit Design

The circuit is based on what is commonly known as a "slayer exciter" version of a Tesla transformer.
The slayer exciter circuit uses feedback from the secondary coil to produce a self-governing oscillation.

This version of the circuit makes some clever additions:

* audio input modulates the current to the coil via the 80NF70 NFET (Q2)
* one LED is modulated by the audio input (D2)
* one LED is modulated by the coild oscillations input (D1)
* the audio-modulated coil (amazingly) vibrates and the plastic tube that is the core of the coil resonantes for this to act as a speaker!

![Schematic](./assets/MusicalKit_schematic.jpg?raw=true)

The essence of the circuit is the "slayer exciter" self-governing oscillation:

* Initially Q1 on, current flow builds in promarimy winding
* magnatic field induces currentin the secondary winding
* secondary sees a very small air-ground capacitor at one end, so initially cannot conduct but starts to pull Q1 base negative
* until Q1 base current throttled enough to turn off
* magnetic field collapses, and flyback voltage discharges into the air (generating a plasma!)

The scope trace below shows these the operation with VCC=14V and no audio input,
with channels connected to J1, J2, J3 (see schematic).

* CH1 (Yellow): J3
* CH2 (Blue): J1
* CH3 (Red): J2

Note the frequency: 3.9 MHz, just a bit above the 80m amateur radio band. This is a few components away from being a morse/CW transmitter;-)

My testing showed:

* at takes about 14V to start arcing
* increased up to 20V but after about 16V it doesn't have an appreciable affect on the arc or sound volume

Some measurements of actual power consumption at different voltages:

| Voltage | Current | Power |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 14V     | 0.5A    | 7W    |
| 18V     | 0.7A    | 13W   |

It can even be used as a basic nixie tube tester!
