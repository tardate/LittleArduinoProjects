Test a Darlington-pair touch switch.

## Notes

A Darlington pair refers to a couple of bipolar transistors connected so that the amplified emitter signal of one is used to drive the second. This results a multiplication of the gain, so the circuit is hyper-sensitive to any input signal.

An ideal applications is a touch switch - the classic demonstration case.

The load in this circuit is just an LED with a current-limiting resistor.
Two NPN transistors form the Darlington-pair.
The circuit works over a wide-range of voltages - basically constrained by the specific transistors used
and the size of the current-limiting resistor (to avoid blowing the LED).

The touch switch control comprises two leads:

* to the base of the Darlington-pair
* to positive power

A 100kÎ© resistor is included to protect against bad things happening if the touch switch is completely shorted.

It doesn't take much to activate the switch:

* touch the base lead only will turn on the Darlington-pair to a degree
* a single finger pressing across the base and power lead will turn the switch hard on
* touch one lead with one hand, and the other lead with the other hand (using your body as the conductor) will also turn the switch hard on
