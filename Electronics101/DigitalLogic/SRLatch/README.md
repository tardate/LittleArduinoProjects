# #061 SR Latch

Set/Reset latch with BJTs.

Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

This is a classic Set-Reset latch.
See [LEAP#062 SRLatchFlipper](../SRLatchFlipper) for a version of this circuit but with Arduino control and monitoring.

In this circuit:

* Switch S1 acts as "Set" (S)
* Switch S2 acts as "Reset" (R)
* Out1 is output state Q
* Out2 is inverted output state -Q

The behaviour is summarised here:

| S  | R  | Action      | Q  | Q next |
|:--:|:--:|-------------|:--:|:------:|
| 0  | 0  | Hold State  | ~  | ~      |
| 1  | 0  | Set         | 0  | 1      |
| 0  | 1  | Reset       | 1  | 0      |
| 1  | 1  | Invalid, n/a| ~  | ~      |

Set/reset are edge-triggering pulses, and pulses only need to be long enough for the transistors to react.
Repeated pulses cause no change to the output.

A power supply from 5-9V is fine.

Here's a great animation of the circuit from wikibooks:

### Latch of Flip-flop?

Although terms are often used interchangeably, this circuit is strictly speaking a "latch".

* a latch is asynchronous, and the outputs can change as soon as the inputs do
* a flip-flop, on the other hand, is edge-triggered and only changes state when a control signal transitions high to low or low to high
