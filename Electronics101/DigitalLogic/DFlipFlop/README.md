# #352 D Flip-Flop

Building a clocked D Flip-flop with 74LS00 NAND gates.

## Notes

The [LEAP#348 DLatch](../DLatch) project demonstrated how to build a "data latch" with NAND gates.
It's operation is asynchronous however - meaning while enabled, the output changes as inputs change.

For digital logic circuits however, it is often preferred to have synchronous changes - meaning the outputs only change on a definitve part of a clock cycle.
These are usually referred to as flip-flops, to distinguish them from asynchronous "latches".

The D flip-flop circuit here is only slightly modified from the latch circuit:

* same NAND-gate construction
* but the enable input is tied to a clock source, with an RC circuit to acta as a rising-edge detector

As a result, output changes only occur on the rising edge of the clock.

As a clock source, I've wired up a simple 74LS14 [Schmitt oscillator](../../Oscillators/SchmittOscillator), with a pretty slow frequency of around
[1.77Hz](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F(1.2+*+1k%CE%A9+*+470%C2%B5F)).

The edge detector is an RC integrator with a time constant of
[0.1ms](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1k%CE%A9*100nF).

To demonstrate the flip-flop behaviour, an Arduino is feeding a data signal at around 10Hz ([100ms](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F10Hz) period).
This is not synchronised with the clock (enable) input, so results are somewhat randomised, allowing for all combinations of inputs to be tested.

Great explanations of the D latch and D Flip-Flop..

## Performance

Channel connections for the following traces:

* CH1 (Yellow) - Q output
* CH2 (Blue) - clock/enable oscillator (unfiltered)
* CH3 (Red) - clock/enable trigger (filtered)
* CH4 (Green) - D input (from Arduino)

This first trace shows output Q transitioning from low to high. Note:

* occurs on the leading edge of the clock/enable pulse
* when data input is high
* does not reset on the falling edge of the clock
* does not reset when data input falls

This second trace shows output Q transitioning from high to low. Note:

* occurs on the leading edge of the clock/enable pulse
* when data input is low
* does not reset on the falling edge of the clock
* does not reset when data input rises
