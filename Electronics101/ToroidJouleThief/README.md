# #137 ToroidJouleThief

Test a [Joule Thief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_thief) circuit based on a ferrite toroid.

## Notes

This circuit achieves a voltage boost, enough to drive an LED with forward voltage in excess of the power supply.
In fact it can continue to run the LED as the battery is depleted.
I haven't tested this yet, but apparently it should work down to a battery voltage of ~0.3V under load

The circuit is all over the internet, but I used
[RimstarOrg's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B61DU7yEsPM)
as a guide.

In this circuit I'm driving a 5mm white strawhat LED, with a forward voltage of 3-3.2V.
No small feat for a single 1.5V AAA!

### Winding the Toroid

I used an 18mm ferrite ring and 30AWG solid core wire.
The two wires are wound in a pair in the same direction - about 10 turns - but they are connected in reverse in the circuit:

| Winding | In From | Out To    |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 1       | V+      | Collector |
| 2       | Base    | 1kÎ©->V+   |

### On a Breadboard..

A 1.44V AAA supply running the LED..

### Squeezed into Battery Pack
Fits a single AA or AAA battery, with a switch added for convenience. Makes a decent night light..
