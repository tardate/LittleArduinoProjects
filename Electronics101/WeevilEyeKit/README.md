## Notes

I saw this kit on
[aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001350039494.html)
for a few dollars, and the nicely designed PCB convinced me to buy a few.

The circuit is simply a pair of light-sensitive LED "eyes". Surprrisingly fun to play with, especially for children.

The circuit is nicely laid out with generous, perfectly prepared pads, so it also makes an ideal kit for learning through-hole soldering.

The kit comes with standard 5mm red LEDs. I replaced these with slow and fast flashing RGB LEDs to spice up the effect.

### The Kit

## Circuit

It is a simple circuit, with the photocell/LDR controlling the low-side NPN transistor:

* when exposed to light, the LDR resistance is lowered pulling the NPN base to ground and cutting the current for the LEDs
* when in darkness, the LDR resistance rises, allowing the 47kÎ© to feed base current to the NPN transistor and turning on the LEDs
* how hard the NPN is turned on will be proportional to the ambient light on the LDR

Here's my transcription of the schematic:
