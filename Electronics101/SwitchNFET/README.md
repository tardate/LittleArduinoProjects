# #066 Digital Logic Switch - N-Channel Enhancement FET

Using a small-signal n-channel MOSFET as a switch, with turn-off delay.

Here's a quick video of the circuit in action:

## Notes

N-Channel Enhancement FETs are easy to use as a digital switch:

* ON when gate-source voltage is much greater than threshold voltage (into saturation region)
* OFF when gate-source voltage is below threshold voltage (0.8-3V for 2N7000)

This circuit demonstrates the basic switch, with the addition of a turn-off delay.

The turn-off delay is implemented with a simple RC circuit: the R1=220kΩ C1=10μF pair having a time constant of
[2.2 seconds](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=220k%CE%A9+*+10%CE%BCF).
