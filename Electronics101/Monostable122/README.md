## Notes

The 74LS122 monostable multivibrator in this circuit has pulse width programmed by selection of external resistance and capacitance values
R2 and C2. Pulse width is given as:

    tW = K * R2 * C2
    => where K is nominally 0.45. If C2 is in μF and R2 is in kΩ then tW is in seconds

For 33μF and 100kΩ then pulse width is [1.485s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.45+*+100+*+10^3+*+33+*+10^-6).
This is intentionally large so that a visible pulse produced.

Once triggered, the basic pulse width may be extended by retriggering the gated low-level-active (A) or high-level-active (B) inputs,
or be reduced by use of the overriding clear.

In this circuit we have a pushbutton to trigger the pulse. LEDs are separately connected to output Q and Q complement,
so they will toggle as the pulse goes high and low respectively.
