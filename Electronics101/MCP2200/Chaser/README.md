# #335 MCP2200/Chaser

Using the MCP2200 GPIO from MacOSX. With great power comes great responsibility to blink LEDs.

Here's quick demo to show it in action:

## Notes

The MCP2200 has 8 GPIO pins that can be used for digital input and output.
Four of the pins have alternative functions which may render them unavailable.

But GPIO on a USB to UART chip?? Perhaps a few reasons:

* for control signals to the attached device (like toggle a reset line)
* for building USB gizmos

I think I'll do the later;-)

### Using the GPIO pins

The I/O pins actually have decent current handling capabilities, from the datasheet:

* Maximum output current sunk or sourced by any I/O pin: 25 mA
* Maximum current sunk or soruced by all ports: 90 mA

Using the GPIO pins for digital output involves two HID commands.

* CONFIGURE: set pin mode in IO_bmap, and
* SET_CLEAR_OUTPUTS to set or clear pin states

Using the GPIO pins for digital input involves two HID commands.

* CONFIGURE: set pin mode in IO_bmap, and
* READ_ALL to get the IO_Port_Val_bmap values



### A Chaser Demo

To test the I/O capabilities, I decided on a simple chaser that employs all 8 GPIO pins:

* GP0 is an active-low input tied to a pushbutton with pull-up resistor and a little RC de-bouncing
* GP1-7 are outputs that control a series of LEDs (configured as active-low, although it could just as well be the other way around)

[chaser.c](./chaser.c) is a simple program using the [hidapi](http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi/) to:

* run a sequence over the LEDs
* reverse direction when the button is pressed

Since there is no interrupt capability for input pins (that I've discovered), the script polls the input every cycle.

### Running the Chaser

I'm running this on MacOSX, but it should work on any *nix-y O/S. Not sure about Windows.

The usual make & run. Here's how it appears in the console:

```
$ make && ./chaser
make: `chaser' is up to date.
Configuring the GPIO pins..
Running the LED chaser thru MCP2200 GPIO (GP1-7); ctrl-c to end ..
.. button pressed on GP0, reversing ..
.. button pressed on GP0, reversing ..
.. button pressed on GP0, reversing ..
^CDeconfiguring the GPIO pins..done. Goodbye!
```

## Construction

I tried this first on a breadboard

Here's a quick demo on the breadboard:

For no particular reason, I decided to put the circuit on a bit of protoboard, with pin headers
to accommodate the MCP2200 DevKit. Here's a sketch of the layout I used:

And here's the final module
