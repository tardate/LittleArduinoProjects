# #122 Op-amp Timer

Test an op-amp timer switch.

## Notes

This circuit uses an  op-amp configured as a comparator to switch an output for a period of time
governed by a variable [RC time constant (𝛕)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant).

The comparator switching point is half the supply voltage, set by the R1/R2 voltage divider.
So with a 5V supply, the switching point is 2.5V.

At steady-state, C1 is fully charged to positive supply and this sets the inverting op-amp input well above the
non-inverting threshold and therefore the op-amp output is off (low).

When S1 is pressed, C1 is fully discharged and the inverting op-amp input pulled low, so op-amp output switches on (high).

When S1 is released, C1 charges through R4+R5, and the op-amp output remains high until the C1 voltage reaches the
switching threshold. R4 is a 50kΩ pot, which allows the switching time to be adjusted.
R1 is included to set a minimum resistance and avoid a short if R4 is dialed to 0Ω.

The time it takes to switch can be determined from the RC complete response formula.
Assuming a 5V supply:

```
v(t) = v(∞) + [v(0) - v(∞)] e^(-t/𝛕)
2.5 = 5 - 5 e^(-t/𝛕)
2.5/5 = e^(-t/𝛕)
ln(0.5) = -t/𝛕
t = - 𝛕 ln(0.5)
```

So the low and high timing limits are:

* when R4+R5=1kΩ and C=47µF: [32ms](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-+%281k%CE%A9*47%C2%B5F%29+*++ln%280.5%29)
* when R4+R5=51kΩ and C=47µF: [1.6s](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-+%2851k%CE%A9*47%C2%B5F%29+*++ln%280.5%29)

Note that the switching logic may be flipped to normally on with a timed off period by switching the inverting/non-inverting inputs.

The LM741 is not capable or rail-to-rail operation. In fact it is not a particularly good op-amp - but it is convenient.
With a 5V supply, the particular unit used here only measures a 2.6V swing:

* output low: 1.6V
* output high: 4.2V

Here's a sample trace of the circuit behaviour recorded using [LEAP#090 PlotNValues (a simple Processing sketch)](https://leap.tardate.com/playground/plotnvalues/)

* upper trace is the op-amp output
* lower trace is the non-inverting input (i.e. C1 voltage)

## Construction

Note: the Arduino is included for measurement purposes only. The circuit does not require it.
When a 5V Arduino like the Uno is attached, the circuit should also be powered at 5V.
Without the Arduino, the supply could be anything within the operating limits of the op-amp,
with perhaps R3 adjusted to limit current to the LED as required.
