# #165 LM2662 Inverter

Test a negative 5V power supply using the LM2662 Switched Capacitor Voltage Converter

![The Build](./assets/LM2662Inverter_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

The LM2662 is a single-chip CMOS charge pump voltage converter:

* 1.5V to 5.5V positive voltage input
* up to 200 mA of output current
* operating efficiency greater than 90% at most loads

There are three basic application topologies:

* voltage inverter (Vout = - Vin)
* voltage divider (Vout = 1/2 Vin)
* voltage doubler (Vout = 2 Vin)

This circuit is a basic test of the voltage inverter configuration, with a few simplifications:

* 5V regulated input voltage
* frequency control is left open, so operates at 20kHz (as opposed to 150kHz)
* I'm using 47ÂµF electrolytic capacitors since they are what I have on hand. The datasheet recommends low-ESR ceramic or tantalum for better performance.

I have some LM2662MX chips in SOP-8 packaging, so I mounted one on an adapter module for easy breadboarding.

The circuit includes a simple LED/resistor fixed load.

### Some Measurements

| Item | Value  | Notes                                       |
|------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| Vin  |  4.97V | from LM7805 regulator powered by 9V battery |
| Vout | -4.96V | with no load                                |
| Vout | -4.83V | with LED/resistor load                      |

Here's Vin (CH1) and Vout (CH2) DC-coupled on a scope, with load attached:

Zooming in on Vout (CH1) AC-coupled to see the ripple:

I'm seeing 200-400mV dropouts every few seconds as captured above. I'm not sure of the source or if that is particularly normal.
The electrolytic capacitors may play a role, so I might measure that again if/when I can get my hands on some
sufficiently large low-ESR ceramic capacitors.

As it is, it seems the inverted voltage output would need further filtering/smoothing and perhaps regulation
for applications requiring a good clean negative voltage supply.
