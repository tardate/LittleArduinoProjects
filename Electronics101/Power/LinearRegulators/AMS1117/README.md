# #153 AMS1117 Regulator

Test an AMS1117 3.3V linear regulator

![The Build](./assets/AMS1117_build.jpg?raw=true)

## Notes

The AMD1117 is a low drop fixed and adjustable voltage regulator from Advanced Monolithic Systems (AMS).
It is similar to "1117" regulators available from a number of manufacturers including UTC and ST.
Parts are available for a range of output voltages, including: 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5V, 2.85V, 3.3V,  and 5.0V.


The component I have
(obtained from [a seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1-Set-10Pcs-Useful-3-3V-1A-AMS1117-LM1117-1117-Voltage-Regulator-SR2985-Free-Shipping/32313333110.html))
is marked: AMS1117-3.3 H1518 in a SOT-223 package.

As given in the datasheet:

* dropout voltage (Vin - Vout): 1.1V typical, 1.3V max
* Vin max: 15V
* current limit: 1.1A typical, 1.5A max
* pin out (from left front): ground, Vout, Vin

Circuit recommendations:

* 22µF tantalum output capacitor

Some DMM measurements, with a 10kΩ output load:

| Vin   | Iin    | Vout  | Iout  | Pin:Pout        |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 5.09V | 2.68mA | 3.29V | 333µA | 13.64mW : 1.1mW |

The inefficiency of a linear regulator is clear to see - we're dissipating 12.74mW in the 1117, far more power than is actually delivered to the load.
But they're convenient!
