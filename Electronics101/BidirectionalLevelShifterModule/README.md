# #134 Bidirectional Level Shifter Module

Test a bi-directional 5/3.3V level shifter module.

## Notes

3.3/5V level-shifting modules are quite common, as the need to interface 5V microcontrollers with 3.3V devices/sensors (or vice versa) is pretty common. Often these are billed for
[I²C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)
or [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus),
although they are non-specific and can be used for level-shifting any kind of digital signal.
Note: yes, digital high/low signals only; they do not provide an analog scaling of voltages.

I got some of these [modules from a seller on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10PCS-Two-Channel-IIC-I2C-Logic-Level-Converter-Bi-Directional-Module-5V-to-3-3V/32213240585.html)

The modules have two pairs of "transmit" and "receive" lines. It turns out that transmit and receive are handled differently:

* TXD/TXI uses a standard MOSFET level shifting circuit, so is usable in either direction with accurate levels
* RXD/RXI uses a simple voltage divider. This is OK for signals from high side to low side, but not in the reverse direction.

## Construction

This circuit is a quick test of their behaviour: a switch in the 5V circuit controlling a load (LED + resistor) in the 3.3V circuit.

This is identical to the test circuit used in the [BidirectionalLevelShifter](../BidirectionalLevelShifter) project,
which demonstrates the basic FET trick used by these modules.

All good! Now to put them to work...
