## Notes

Digital switches seem to be well suited for switching applications that are more complex than can be achieved with a simple FET or BJT,
but lower power than might be more suited to a relay. Particular applications I have in mind are switching amplifier gain stages,
filter gangs, and circuit subsystems.

They are available in a range of pole/throw configuration, and importantly with defined make-before-break or break-before-make behaviour.

I'm testing a TS3A5018 here, which I obtained already populated on a convenient breakout module.

The TS3A5018 is a 1.8 to 3.6V device with four SPDT switches controlled from a single input, and a master active-low enable pin.
It is guaranteed break-before-make (max 58ns).

## Code Example

The [TS3A5018.ino](./TS3A5018.ino) sketch uses two of the switches in a simple demonstration with an Arduino Uno and 555 timer:

* one switch alters the timing capacitor in a 555 astable oscillator, switching the frequency from [1 Hz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=1&r2=300&c=2.2) to  [2.4 Hz](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=1&r2=300&c=1)
* another switch changes the LED (color) running on the oscillator output

The TS3A5018 is only rated for 1.8 to 3.6V, so a 3.3V rail is used for the offboard circuit, and simple voltage divider level-shifts the Arduino output pin.
