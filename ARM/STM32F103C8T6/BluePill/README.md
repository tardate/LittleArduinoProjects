Programming an ARM Cortex-M3 STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill board with the Arduino IDE.

## Notes

Popularly known as the [Blue Pill](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill),
the STM32F103C8T6 Minimum System Development Board seems like an excellent gateway drug for getting into ARM Cortex-M3 development.

This is particularly true as it is possible to program it with the familar Arduino IDE.

This is my first look at one of these boards, so I have simple expectations - follow along some of the tutorials
on the web/youtube and at least get a simple program running on the board. In the process I'll learn
a bit more about the board's capabilities and quirks.

## Board Specs

* ARM Cortex M3
* 72 MHz
* 64 KB
* 20 KB RAM
* Reset button
* LED on PIN PC13
* 32 kHz Real time clock crystal
* Jump links on Boot0 and Boot1
* Micro USB connector for power and data
* ST-Link header on the top of the board.

### Pinouts

### Power

The STM32F103C8 operates from 2.0 to 3.6V.
The development board includes a 3.3V LDO regulator, and since many pins are 5V-tolerant, this allows the board to be used
with 5V USB power.

## Programming with the Arduino IDE

I'm following the
[STM32 Arduino Tutorial - How to use the STM32F103C8T6 board with the Arduino IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-jYSysmw9w)
YouTube tutorial by educ8s.tv. This is one of many, but it is the most accurate and up-to-date that I found in a quick search.

Here's how the process went for me....

### Adding Board Support to the IDE

NB: I'm running Arduino IDE 1.8.2 on MacOSX at the time of this test.

A Boards Manager package is created by Dan Drown, the instructions are on
[the stm32duino site](http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Boards_Manager_package)

Add custom boards package [package_STM32duino_index.json](http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json) in Preferences

![setup_board_manager](./assets/setup_board_manager.png?raw=true)

Install the `STM32F1xx/GD32F1xx boards` package by stm32duino in the Board Manager:

### Connecting a Serial Programmer

I'm using a CH340G USB-serial adapter from MacOSX (similar but different to FTDI-based adapters).

Connections are as follows:

| USB-Serial | BluePill |
|------------|----------|
|  GND       |  GND     |
|  VCC       |  5V      |
|  RXD       |  A9      |
|  TXD       |  A10     |

### Configuring the IDE

The default settings that work with this board are as follows:

* Board: Generic STM32F103C series
* Variant: STM32F103C8 (20k RAM. 64k Flash)
* CPU Speed: 72MHz
* Upload method: Serial
* Port: (as selected based on USB connection)

### Uploading Sketch

The [Blink.ino](./Blink/Blink.ino) sketch is just about the simplest thing possible - blinks the LED connected on port PC13.
This is not showing off the board capabilities at all - I'm just trying to verify the programming process.

| BOOT0 | BOOT1 | Mode |
|-------|-------|------|
| 0     | x     | Boot from User Flash. This is normal operating mode. |
| 1     | 0     | Boot from System Memory. This contains the embedded bootloader, and is used for programming |
| 1     | 1     | Boot from embedded SRAM. Used for other STM32 variants, but not the STM32F10x |

For programming, the BluePill Boot0 jumper is set to 1 (pulled high).

From the Arduino IDE, the program compiled and uploaded over serial without any issue..

After disconnecting the serial programmer and switching the BluePill Boot0 jumper to 0 (pulled low),
the board can be powered from USB with the program running:
