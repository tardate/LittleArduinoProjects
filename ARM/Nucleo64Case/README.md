## Notes

The following are the designs I have checked out so far, printed at the [library](../../Equipment/NLB/FlashforgeCreatorPro2/).

## Base 1: STM32 Nucleo coaster

A basic mounting plate - ideal for protecting the board on the workbench without inhibiting access.

Printed and ready to mount the STM32U385RG:

Attached with M2.9x6.5 screws -
only used 2, the third is unnecessary and little too tight a fit against the D15 header.

## Base 2: Nucleo Case Openscad by ChrisDSA

Not tried yet.
A more substantial base; should not require screws to attach the board.

## Base 3: Nucleo-64 development board base

Not tried yet.
Minimal mounting frame. Seems to be an issue with the central cylinder - seems redundant.
