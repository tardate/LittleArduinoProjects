## Notes

Somewhere in my travels -
IIRC, at [Five Below]([diy spiderbot tech kit](https://www.fivebelow.com/diy-spiderbot-tech-kit.html) -
I picked up a cheap "spider" robot kit .. I think because I wanted to examine how they drive the legs.

But for something a little more interesting, I thought I'd combine this with
[LEAP#290 Boldport PissOff](../../BoldportClub/PissOff).
The result: a motion alarm that not only barks at you, but scuttles back and forth.

I think I'm channelling [Sid from Toy Story](http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Sid_Phillips) ..


### SpiderBot Kit

It's a pretty cheap and basic kit, with a simple direct drive motor system that only does one thing.
Good for about 15 minutes fun I guess!

the way they drive the legs with offset cams is pretty interesting, and impressive how they've managed to
deliver it as a press-fit plastic kit.

Assembled the "normal" way...

### Linking the PissOff

The PissOff has an active low "audio enable" signal that appears to be the most useful trigger to
use to control the SpiderBot mechanism. It goes low (~0V) when the alarm is sounding. At other times it is at Vcc (~3V).

Unfortunately, there is no existing breakout for this signal, so it requires a bodge wire to tap the circuit.
I attached at pin 1 of IC1 - the most accessible point.

### Rewiring the SpiderBot drive system

I decided to use a simple oscillator to get the spider legs to go forward and reverse when triggered by the PissOff.

I'm using a 555 timer is configured for a fairly slow ~50% duty cycle of around
[2.3s high / 2.3s low](http://visual555.tardate.com/?mode=astable&r1=1&r2=330&c=10).


The difficulty turnout out to be getting it to control the motor.
It is a terribly noisy motor in the SpiderBot! I tried a few other DC motors that I can drive quite effectively,
but this one is totally obnoxious!

* it totally messes with the 555 timer circuit
* I've tried all manner of isolation:
    - motor is switch with relay (with flyback diode)
    - I've tried totally isolated electics (no common ground). It didn't help so the current incarnation does have a common ground.
    - hefty smoothing/bypass capacitors
    - importantly C7 capacitor across the relay switching FET was critical in getting anything decent

I refused to give up, though the results I have so far are not great.
It does not have a balanced duty cycle:

* proceeds forward (motor relay normally open) OK
* but the reverse cycle (motor relay closed) is unstable - it gets tripped off very easily

Here's what happens to my nice uniform 555 square wave when the motor is attached an under load:

## Motor Controls

I've drawn up the motor control system with  EasyEDA -

## Construction

And here's the basic layout on to a protoboard "backpack" for the PissOff:
