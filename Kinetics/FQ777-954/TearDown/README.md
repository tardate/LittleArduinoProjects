## Notes

The FQ777-954 and its derivatives (RC Leading RC101W, Cheerson CX-10W..) is a pretty hot item if one can judge
by the number of unboxing and flight test reports - a simple [search on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=FQ777-954)
will find a few thousand. I get the impression someone has been flooding the market with review units!

What is much harder to come by is good technical information beyond the usual product feature specs.

I recently got an [FQ777-954](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/FQ777-954-mini-Drone-The-Eyes-RC-Quadcopter-WIFI-FPV-with-720P-Camera-4CH-6Axis-APP/32641566808.html). And yes I can confirm its fun and pretty amazing for such a small package!

Since I'm interesting in exploring ways of controlling it with my own electronics and code, I first wanted to
study the technical design and specs. Good information is hard to come by, but the following is the best I've been able
to figure out and collate to date.

### Product Specifications

This is basically the extent of the information available from most sources:

* Channel: 4CH Gyro: 6 axis Flight Duration: 6-7 Minutes Quadcopter Control Distance: 30 meters
* Recharging Time: 25mins Battery For Quadcopter: 3.7V 150mAh/25C(included) Battery For Transmiter: 2 x AAA Battery (not included)
* Quadcopter weight: 17g
* Product size: 60x60x26mm
* Camera: 0.3Megapixel(480P)/Photo Quality 640x480 / Video Quality 640x480,30FPS
* Function: WIFI FPV camera/Take photo/Record video/up/down/forward/backward/side flying/360˚rolling action/hover/3D/LED

Note that many listings claim 720P but actually ship as 480P. FQ do make 720P drones but as far as I can tell,
there is no 720P version of the FQ777-954 (yet).

### Manufacturer

The FQ777-954 is produced by [Fu Qi / FQ Model Factory](http://fuqitoys.en.alibaba.com/) located in the Chinese Toys Town -- Chenghai, Shantou City, Guangdong Province. They design, manufacture and sell a range or drones, RC models and other toys and have been around since 1997.

They also offer OEM arrangements, so it is possible that other "similar" drones are actually originally manufactured by FQ.

### Mechanical Design - Propulsion

The FQ777-954 uses a conventional quadcoptor configuration of counter-rotating propellers to offset torque:

### Disassembly

Parts out of the box. This is the "BNF" version (no controller). It also comes in an "RTF" version with controller.
Without a controller, it can be flown with the RC Leading mobile application.

The top comes of:

* remove the rotors - requires a bit of force or a level/tool (they are press-fit)
* remove the 4 screw on the underside of the rotor arms

Close-up of the top:

* main processor board, with an unidentified processor chip and camera attached by ribbon cable
* sitting on the receiver board, which also runs wires to the the 4 motors

The bottom shell comes off by unclipping from the four arms of the receiver board:

* 3.7V 150mAh LiPo battery

Underside of the main processor board, featuring:

* Marvell Wi-Fi SoC
* BergMicro SPI Flash memory

### Processor Board

The main detail I haven't been able to pin down is perhaps the most important - which processor does it use?
The identification has been etched off, but I'm guessing it's something like a Cortex M3.

Main components:

* CPU - unidentified
* [Marvell 88W8801 IEEE 802.11n (1x1) single-band (2.4GHz) Wi-Fi SoC with integrated PA, LNA, and TX/RX Switch](http://www.marvell.com/microcontrollers/wi-fi-microcontroller-platform/wi-fi/)
* [BergMicro BG25Q80ASICG 8M-bit Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI) Flash memory](http://www.trolink.cn/Products/BG25Q80A.html)


### Receiver Board

The so-called receiver board also doubles as the structural component that holds the motors in position as well as the LEDs.
