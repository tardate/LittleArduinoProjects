# #215 OSHChip/YottaToolchain

Build a simple program using the Official Yotta target for OSHChip and gcc on MacOSX


## Notes

After bruising myself on the raw [GccToolchain](../GccToolchain) - and although I got a program running -
I'm thinking I want my toolchain to do more of the hard work for me!

So let's try [yotta](https://github.com/ARMmbed/yotta), the software module system used by mbed OS.

### First - Don't Do This

The OSX Installer from [mbed yotta](https://www.mbed.com/en/development/software/mbed-yotta/#Installing_yotta)
looked like the easy path. But after installing, I started seeing `certificate verify failed` errors when yotta
tried to contact the yotta registry.

Turns out this is a very old build (despite just downloading minutes ago)..

```
$ yotta --version
0.8.3
```

### Try The Real Way

Use [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) and [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)!

This procedure is outlined on [yottadocs](http://yottadocs.mbed.com/#installing).

```
$ brew tap ARMmbed/homebrew-formulae
$ brew install cmake ninja arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

NB: I already have python installed, so I skipped the `brew install python`.

Before installing yotta, I used [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
to create and activate an isolated python environment for yotta development:

```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Next install yotta:

```
$ pip install yotta
# or use the requirements.txt file I have here:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How are we doing?

```
$ yotta --version
0.16.4
```
.. that's looking a bit more healthy.


### Initialise the Project

```
$ yotta init
Enter the module name: <yottatoolchain>
Enter the initial version: <0.0.0>
Is this an executable (instead of a re-usable library module)? <no> yes

```

NB: the transcript above wasn't the first time I ran those commands.
The first time I did the `yotta install mbed-drivers` it punched me out to the mbed site for authentication.

### Write a Program!

Or in this case, "borrow" it from [target-OSHChip-gcc/*/examples/blinky.cpp](https://github.com/OSHChip/target-OSHChip-gcc/blob/master/examples/blinky.cpp)!

```
$ curl -Lo source/blinky.cpp https://github.com/OSHChip/target-OSHChip-gcc/blob/master/examples/blinky.cpp?raw=true
```

### Build It

```
$ yotta build
info: generate for target: oshchip-gcc 1.1.4 at /Users/paulgallagher/MyGithub/LittleArduinoProjects/OSHChip/YottaToolchain/yotta_targets/oshchip-gcc
warning: subdirectory "test" of yottatoolchain 0.0.0 at /Users/paulgallagher/MyGithub/LittleArduinoProjects/OSHChip/YottaToolchain was ignored because it doesn't appear to contain any source files

```

It's done. Now where's my program? Found it, `yottatoolchain-combined.hex` weighing in at a handsome 404kb!

```
$ ls -sk1 build/oshchip-gcc/source/
total 1308
  0 CMakeFiles
  4 CMakeLists.txt
  4 CTestTestfile.cmake
  4 cmake_install.cmake
428 yottatoolchain
404 yottatoolchain-combined.hex
 40 yottatoolchain.bin
112 yottatoolchain.hex
312 yottatoolchain.map

```

Looking at the the first few lines of `yottatoolchain-combined.hex` I can see it setting:
* Start Linear Address: 0x0001CBF1
* Extended Linear Address: 0x0000 upper 16 bits

```
:040000050001CBF13A
:020000040000FA

...
```
### Send it to the OSHChip

I have the OSHchip & programmer plugged into my USB and appearing as `/Volumes/Untitled/`.

So copying it over...

```
$ cp build/oshchip-gcc/source/yottatoolchain-combined.hex /Volumes/Untitled/
```

Presto, the OSHChip rebooted and is now blinking the Red onboard LED every half a second.
